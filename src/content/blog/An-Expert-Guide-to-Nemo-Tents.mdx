title: An Expert Guide to Nemo Tents
---

TLDR\:When shopping for a tent, take into account the type of camping you're planning on doing, the weather you'll primarily be in, and the number of people you'll need to fit in your tent. From there, you can narrow down the exact type of tent best suited for you. No matter what kind of camper you are, Nemo is sure to have a tent that checks all your boxes.

Being an avid camper my whole life and having worked in the outdoor industry for the past seven years, I have stayed pretty up-to-date as to what's hot and what's not in the outdoor gear world. Nemo Equipment is a brand that reliably makes high-quality products year after year. I've tried, owned, and tested several of their tents, sleeping bags, and sleeping pads over the years, and I've never been disappointed with any of their gear. I truly think everything they make is impressive, but my favorite products of theirs by far have been their tents. They are super user-friendly and built to last.

As a Camping and Hiking Expert here on Curated, Nemo is a go-to brand that I am consistently recommending to campers who use our free chat service to ask about tent recommendations. In this article, I'll go over everything you need to know about Nemo's tent offerings!

## Who is Nemo?

Nemo Equipment is a big name in the outdoor gear world, making everything from camp tables to[camp showers](https://www.curated.com/journal/2290002/an-expert-guide-to-portable-camping-showers?ref=journal)to sleeping bags. One of the products they are most well-known for is their tents. They have many tent options that expertly balance livability, low weight, and durability. No matter what kind of camping trip you plan, Nemo has a tent option that will keep you sheltered and fast asleep every night so you can be on your game and ready to explore every morning.

Nemo also has an impressive commitment to sustainability. They put extra care into responsible material sourcing and minimizing waste during production, making this the ultimate brand for outdoor enthusiasts who want their gear dollars to go towards a company actively trying to minimize their footprint on the planet we all love to explore.

## What to Consider When Buying a Nemo Tent

Before looking at exact Nemo tents, you'll want to answer a few questions to help you hone in on exactly what you need in your new tent. Here are the primary considerations to think about before committing to a tent!

### What type of camping are you doing?

Nemo has a few different[types of tents](https://www.curated.com/journal/6000/what-are-the-different-types-of-tents?ref=journal)suited to different camping styles (more on the different types later). First, you need to determine the type of camping you're planning on doing. If you're a backpacker, you'll want a lightweight tent that's compact and easy to fit in your[backpacking bag.](https://www.curated.com/journal/13000/what-to-bring-into-the-wild-a-backpackers-checklist?ref=journal)If you are acar camper, comfort and space might be more of a priority. If you want to do a mix of both, Nemo has some great options that are light enough to bring on the occasional backpacking trip and that don't skimp on the comfort features found in car camping tents.

### What seasons do you plan on camping?

Tents come in three different seasonality ratings.[One-season tents](https://www.curated.com/journal/2692000/the-best-tents-for-camping-in-the-summer?ref=journal)are lightweight and well-ventilated, perfect for camping during the warm summer months. Three-season tents are the most common type of tent and the most versatile since they can be used in the spring, summer, and fall. They are light enough to keep you cool on hot summer nights but can handle some heavy wind and[rain](https://www.curated.com/journal/3256000/the-best-tents-for-camping-in-the-rain?ref=journal)you might get if you are camping in the spring or fall. Four-season tents are rated for winter as well as spring, summer, and fall.[Four-season tents](https://www.curated.com/journal/3218000/the-best-winter-tents-for-camping-in-the-cold?ref=journal)will stay stable and keep you dry and warm in snowstorms, but the extra features that make them capable in winter also add some weight and reduce airflow, so they are a bit heavier and warmer than you might want for summer backpacking trips, and they are harder to keep cool if you're sleeping in them during the summer.

### What size do you need?

Nemo has some great[2-person tent options](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/b/nemo/f-tent-capacity/2?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)for sleeping in a tent with just one other person! Photo courtesy of Nemo

Next up, determine how many campers you want to be able to accommodate inside your tent. If it's just you, a one-person tent will suffice. But if you're camping with your family, you'll want something bigger that can sleep more people.

If you're car camping and weight isn't as much of a concern, I recommend getting a tent with a little extra room to be more comfortable. For example, if you're car camping with one other person, instead of getting a 2-person tent, opt for a 3-person tent.

You'll also want to factor in any pets you plan to bring on camping trips. I primarily sleep in my tent alone with my 40 lb border collie, and I prefer two-person tents so she has the floor area to spread out instead of sleeping on top of me.

### What’s your budget?

Nemo has an array of different options to meet every budget. The least expensive models are around $150 to $250, and they are basic but reliable and great for occasional camping in moderate weather.

If you want something with extra features or more technology (lower weight, stronger tent poles), you'll want to opt for a mid-range Nemo tent, which will be around $250 to $500.

The high-end models will be the best fit for super serious campers who want the lowest-weight option or something really sturdy for winter camping. Those are generally $500+.

Determining your camping style, tent size, and seasonality will help you narrow down exactly what you need. It will also prevent you from getting a cheap tent that doesn't fit your camping style well or from getting an over-the-top expensive tent that's overkill for your casual and occasional trips.

## Types of Nemo Tents

Now that you understand the basics of things to think about before looking for a tent, let's jump into the different types of tents Nemo has to offer.

### [Car Camping Tents](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/b/nemo/f-tent-use-case/camping?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)

These tents are meant for more casual camping at sites right next to your vehicle. They typically have more features and space than the other types of tents since they can pack a lot of bells and whistles without concern for how much the tent weighs.

Benefits:

- More space and more comfortable than other types
- Most feature options available across various tent models (larger vestibules, more storage inside the tent,[multi room](https://www.curated.com/journal/3410001/the-best-multi-room-tents-for-your-family-friends?ref=journal)options, etc.)

Be Aware:

- Bulkier and heavier than some other Nemo tents
- Not as versatile as other types of tents since they can only be used for car camping as opposed to the tents we’ll talk about later in this list that can be used for backpacking and other types of camping adventures, as well as car camping

### [Backpacking Tents](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/b/nemo/f-tent-use-case/backpacking?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)

If you're a backpacker or if you want to have the option to bring your tent along on a backpacking trip down the line, this type of tent is for you. They are more compact and lighter than classic car camping tents, making it easier to carry long distances and pack conveniently in your backpacking bag with the rest of your gear.

Benefits:

- Light enough to be used for backpacking trips
- More spacious and durable than ultralight tents

Be Aware:

- Not as roomy or comfortable as car camping tents
- More expensive than car camping tents

### Ultralight Tents

Ultralight tents are a lot like backpacking tents but are even more compact and lightweight. They're intended for backpackers who have a lot of gear to haul (such as for a week or a longer trip) or who want to shave as many ounces as possible off their overall gear weight. For more information about ultralight tents,[check out this article](https://www.curated.com/journal/3399000/the-best-ultralight-backpacking-tents?ref=journal)!

Benefits:

- Super lightweight and compact for easier carrying
- Generally very easy to set up

Be Aware:

- Minimal interior space
- Sometimes, the lightweight material can cause the tent to be less durable
- More expensive than backpacking or car camping tents

### Mountaineering Tents

Last but not least, if you plan on camping in extreme conditions such as snow or heavy wind and rain, you will want to go for a mountaineering tent. They are designed for extreme alpine conditions and are generally rated for all 4 seasons, yet are still light enough to carry in a backpack easily.

Benefits:

- Most durable option, can handle any kind of extreme weather
- Lightweight enough to carry in a backpack
- Versatile and can be used year round no matter the weather or type of camping you’re doing

Be Aware:

- Most expensive type of tent
- Not as much ventilation during the warm months as other types of tents
- Most complicated setup

## Features to Look for in Nemo Tents

A few features and technologies are specific to Nemo brand tents:

- [OSMO Fabric Technology](https://www.nemoequipment.com/blogs/journal/osmo%E2%84%A2-a-no-compromise-approach-to-fabric-performance-sustainability?ref=journal)\:New in 2023, this fabric is high-tech and ultra-waterproof. It has less stretch when wet compared to traditional tent fabrics and is lighter, making it a great option for ultralight backpackers or mountaineering enthusiasts who need top-tier weather protection.
- AirSupported Technology\:For ultralight backpackers, these tents use inflatable beams instead of classic metal tent poles. This makes the tent overall lightweight and more packable.
- Landing Zone Gear Storage\:If you're backpacking, you will likely store your gear outside under a rainfly or in the vestibule area so you don't have to cram it into your sleeping quarters. Though the rainfly will protect your gear from light rain when it's not inside the tent, it can still get wet if the rain really starts coming down. This feature is essentially a waterproof, collapsible storage cube in which you can store your gear so it won't get wet when it's outside.
- Divvy Dual-Storage Stuff Sack\:Most tents have one stuff sack for the poles, stakes, rainfly, and tent body. This Dual-Storage sack divides the tent into two separate sacks, one with the tent and stakes and one with the rainfly and poles. For backpackers who want to split the load of carrying the tent, this is a useful feature.
- Easy Setup Features\:Some Nemo tents have extra design features that help with the setup process, so you can spend less time fighting with your tent poles and more time exploring your campsite. If this is an important feature to you, look for tents with color-coded poles and sockets and a quick attach pole clip design.
- Advanced Tensioning System (ATS): Most tents have some guylines to stake your tent or rainfly walls out to provide more stability in wind or rain. Nemo's ATS is by far the most advanced and has more strategically placed guy lines on the tent's body and rainfly, ensuring your tent doesn't flap around or cave in under heavy wind. This is a must-have if you camp in extreme weather conditions or if you're a light sleeper who wakes up whenever the tent moves around.

## How To Choose The Right Nemo Tent for You

We've covered a lot of information in this article, and hopefully, it's given you an idea of what to look for when shopping for your Nemo tent, but if you still need to decide which model is for you, no worries! Below are three examples of Curated customers I have helped find their perfect Nemo tent.

### Tyler, the Ultralight Backpacker

Tyler does a lot of backpacking across a lot of different areas. He generally goes on longer trips and wants to pack as light as possible. He doesn't share a tent with any tent mates and needs an ultralight shelter that can handle different weather and terrain.

Features Tyler Should Look for in a Tent:

### Emma, the Family Camper

All of Emma's trips are with her family in and around national parks where there’s easy car camping. Comfort, space, and an easy setup are her top priorities, and weight doesn’t matter much to her at all since she is always camping close to her vehicle. Most of her trips are in sunny weather – primarily during spring and summer.

Needs in a Tent:

- Spacious interior and plenty of headroom
- Easy setup and takedown
- Enough vents to keep cool on warm nights

Features Emma Should Look for in a Tent:

- Internal organization, such as gear lofts and pockets
- Large vestibules for extra storage
- Overhead Light Pockets for ambient lighting
