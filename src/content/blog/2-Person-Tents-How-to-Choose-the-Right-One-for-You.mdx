TLDR\:When choosing a 2-person tent, consider what you’re planning to use it for, the weather you primarily camp in, and what features are useful or important to you in a tent. Though the tent that best suits you will vary depending on your situation, the right 2-person tent will generally offer a balance of functionality, comfort, and cost.

My name is Hunter, and although I have only been a Camping and Hiking Expert here on Curated for 2 years, I have been an avid camper for over 20 years. I have tried my fair share of 2-person tents on all kinds of camping trips from backpacking to car camping and everything in between. In this article I will break down the key need-to-know information when shopping for the perfect 2-person tent so that you can be well prepared and informed when buying your next tent!

## What is a 2-Person Tent?

A 2-person tent, like other camping tents, is a portable shelter that you can sleep in or hang out in to get some protection from the elements when you're on camping or backpacking trips. Two person tents in particular are designed to sleep two people and have enough room for storing 2 peoples gear inside the tent. There are tons of different types of 2-person tents, some intended for more backpacking style trips (which prioritize low weight and a compact design) and some intended for car camping (which prioritize space and comfort without much concern to weight of the tent). 2-person tents are a great starter option for campers who are looking for their first tent, and they are a versatile option for campers who want something that they can use for both backpacking and camping. We’ll get into more specifics later in this article!

## What To Consider When Shopping for a 2-Person Tent

Before you start looking at specific 2-person tents, it’s helpful to ask yourself a few questions to hone in on what it is you need out of your tent. Here are a few of the main things to think about!

### What kind of camping are you doing?

The first step in narrowing down the exact 2-person tent for you is to determine what kind of camping you will be doing. If you’re backpacking, you’ll want a lightweight tent that is compact when packed down and can easily fit into your backpack. If you’re car camping you likely won’t care much about weight, but will want something comfortable that has more room inside. If you want a do-it-all tent for both car camping and backpacking, there are some tents that aren’t necessarily backpacking tents, but are light and small enough to fit in your pack and are still large enough to be comfortable for car camping trips.

### What seasons and weather will you be camping in?

Next, consider what kind of weather you expect to mostly encounter. Tents are rated for either[1-season](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/f-season-rating/summer?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)(summer),[3-season](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/f-season-rating/3-season?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)(summer, spring, fall), or[4-season](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/f-season-rating/4-season?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)(summer, spring, fall, and winter). 4-season tents are overkill if you don’t expect to camp in the winter at all, but if you do think you’ll do some winter camping, a 4 season tent will be crucial to keeping you warm and protected from snowstorms. 1-season tents are great if you’re[camping in only warm months](https://www.curated.com/journal/2692000/the-best-tents-for-camping-in-the-summer?ref=journal)as they usually prioritize low weight and ventilation, but they wont be able to handle heavy rain or keep you as warm at night as a 3-season tent.

After you figure out what season tent you need, think about the specific weather in the areas you generally camp. Most camping trips in the Pacific Northwest will involve some rainy conditions, so a tent that has extra waterproofing would be a great option. If you really only camp in the desert, ventilation will be a priority as it can stay pretty hot even in the middle of the night in the desert.

### Is easy setup important to you?![](/uploads/2pt/24.avif)

Setting up and taking down the tent is often the most dreaded task on camping trips. Some tents are easier to set up than others and some have features such as color coded poles or quick attach clips intended to make setting up your tent easier. If you, like many campers, hate setting up and taking down your tent - make sure you get something that’s easy to use! No matter which tent you end up going with, make sure you set it up in your yard or living room at least once before heading out on your trip so you have a general idea of how to use it before you’re setting it up in a real life situation!

### What extra features might be useful for you?![](/uploads/2pt/25.avif)

There are an array of feature options in 2-person tents, some which might be useful for you and some which might not. We will talk more about features later on in this guide, but as a brief overview - some tents have extra covered storage space outside the tent, pockets or gear lofts inside the tent, carry options that allow you to split the weight between two backpackers packs instead of just one, extra weather protection features, and the list goes on and on. Thinking about features that might be helpful to you in a tent can significantly help you narrow down the right two-person tent for you.

### What’s your budget?

Tent prices can range quite a bit depending on different materials, features, and uses for the tent. If you have a budget in mind that can be helpful as there are sturdy, simple options starting at around $120 and more high tech ultralight options that can ring in closer to $500. The actual amount you might spend will vary based on the kind of tent you’re after and the features that are useful to you, but it can still be a great starting point to have a budget in mind when shopping around.

## What are the Different Types of 2-Person Tents?

Now that you’ve narrowed down what you need in a tent, let’s go over the different types of 2-person tents available.

### Backpacking Tent

Backpacking tents come in different shapes and styles, but their key feature is that they are lightweight and compact. This makes it easy to pack them in your backpacking pack without taking up too much room or adding too many ounces to your overall pack weight.

Benefits:

- Lightweight and compact
- Designed to be quick to set up
- Durable to withstand harsh weather in the backcountry

Be Aware:

- Pricier than other types of tents
- Not as spacious as car camping tents

### Dome Tent

###

These are the classic style tents with a rounded top and two or three poles that arc over the top. They can again come in different sizes and styles, and are great for a variety of campers. Generally they are quite a bit easier to set up compared to tunnel tents or geodesic tents.

Benefits:

- Good headroom inside the tent
- Stable shape for windy conditions
- Usually pretty easy to setup

Be Aware:

- Can be less spacious than some other types of tents
- Not a great option for winter camping

### Tunnel Tent

This type of tent uses a series of curved poles to create a tent with a tunnel-type shape. They are a little harder to setup than a dome tent, but usually have more internal room, and more external gear storage space in the vestibule.

Benefits:

- Good space to weight ratio
- More storage outside of the tent for gear, making for a less crowded inside
- Stable in snow, wind, or heavy rain

Be Aware:

- More complicated to set up and when setup incorrectly it can seriously impact their stability in bad weather
- Depending on the model, typically not as well ventilated

### Geodesic Tent

Geodesic tents are super-charged dome tents. They have the same curved top shape, but way more poles that intersect at more points, making them more stable in snow or harsh winds. They are usually burlier and not as well ventilated. Unless you plan on winter camping, you likely won’t want a geodesic tent.

Benefits:

- Great 4-season option for all weather
- Extremely stable and durable
- More interior space than dome, tunnel, or backpacking tents

Be Aware:

- Heavier than other types of tents
- More complicated and time consuming to setup
- Not as well ventilated for camping in warm conditions
- Most expensive option

### Pop Up Tent

As the name suggests, these tents are meant to spring into shape without the need to assemble any poles. They are a great option for campers who want the easiest possible setup and don’t expect to encounter much weather. These come in an array of materials, from canvas tents that are durable but not well-ventilated, to lightweight polyester which keeps you cool, but is more prone to ripping. These are not as common, and are mostly just tailored to casual campers or festival campers.

Benefits:

- Easy to setup
- Come in a variety of styles for different types of camping situations.

Be Aware:

- Not as versatile as other types of tents
- Generally not as good in bad weather
- Depending on the exact tent, they might not be very durable

## Features to Look out for when Buying a 2-Person Tent

There’s quite a variety when it comes to features in 2-person tents. Below are some of the main features to look for when shopping around for your next tent. Some of them might not be useful to your particular camping situation, but regardless it’s helpful to know what’s out there so you can dial in the exact right tent for you!

### Tent Material

One of the first things that you should pay attention to when buying your tent is the type of fabric it’s made out of. Tent bodies are usually made out of one of these three fabrics:

- Ripstop Fabric: This is a reinforced nylon that is woven in a way that helps prevent tears. If your ripstop tent does happen to get a hole or tear in it, the fabric is designed to prevent that from spreading, giving you time to patch it up or fix it without worry that it’s going to get worse.
- Polyurethane Coated Fabric: Polyurethane is a waterproof coating that improves the tent’s water resistance, helping you stay dry on camping trips where it’s pouring rain. Polyurethane coating is pretty common and seen on most tents, but if you’re shopping specifically for an ultralight tent, you might see tents with a silnylon coating. Silnylon is a silicone nylon coating that’s a bit lighter weight than polyurethane, but also a bit pricier.
- Dyneema: Dyneema is the latest tent fabric technology which is super strong, and super lightweight. It’s also the priciest of all the tent fabric materials, so it’s not super common unless you’re looking at ultralight tents. Dyneema is incredibly waterproof and it’s also more resistant to UV damage than other tent fabric materials, so despite the high price point, it’s a worthy investment to campers who prioritize durability.

### Tent Pole Material

Once you’ve narrowed down the best tent body material for your camping needs, it’s time to check out the material of the tent poles. Poles provide the overall support for the tent and bear the brunt of wind and rain, so it’s important to have high quality poles to keep your tent functional! Most poles are made out of one of these three materials:

- Aluminum: This is the go-to choice for most campers. It’s a great balance between strength and weight and aluminum poles are more durable than fiberglass, making them a preferred choice for high-quality tents. Aluminum also tends to bend under pressure instead of snapping (as fiberglass and carbon fiber do) so some campers also prefer aluminum because if something does go wrong with a tent pole, it’s much easier to bend an aluminum pole back into place as opposed to fixing a snapped in half carbon fiber pole.
- Fiberglass: Fiberglass poles are heavier and less durable compared to aluminum but are generally more affordable, so the best budget option for wallet-conscious campers. If weight and durability are less of a concern than cost, these poles will still get the job done.
- Carbon Fiber: These poles are the high end option, offering the best strength-to-weight ratio. They are extremely lightweight and strong, making them the go-to choice for ultralight backpacking tents.

### Seam Taping or Welding

Seam taping or seam welding are processes which add an extra seal to the seams of the tent to prevent any water from leaking in through the tiny, tiny holes from the manufacturing of the tent. This is a really helpful feature if you’re camping in the rain. Not all tents have this, but if your camping trips are primarily in areas that get a lot of precipitation, it’s a must-have.

### Ventilation

Ventilation is another key thing to consider when shopping for your tent. Proper ventilation keeps you cool in warm weather, and reduces condensation inside the tent if you’re camping in cold weather. Without proper ventilation, you’re going to be waking up too warm in the middle of the night, or waking up with your sleeping bag and gear soaked from the condensation on cold nights. Ventilation comes in different versions in different tents, some tents have large windows, or a mesh ceiling which are both plenty of ventilation to keep you dry and comfortable at night. If there is a mesh over windows or doors, make sure its a No-See-Um Mesh which is a very fine mesh with holes that are small enough to keep out even little bugs.

### Organization

Most tents come with gear lofts, gear loops, or pockets on the inside of the tent. These are a great tool to have inside your tent because it gives you a place to store important things that you’d need easy access to - such as your car keys, headlamp, or satellite phone. If you expect you’ll spend a lot of time in your tent at night reading, a gear loft is a great place to store a light so that you can have enough illumination to read your book at night without the need to hold a light. In terms of external organization, some tents come with extended vestibules which are outside of the body of the tent, but are still covered by the rain fly. Vestibules are great for giving you somewhere to store your shoes, backpack, and gear where it’s going to be protected, but isn’t going to crowd your internal space!

### Easy Setup

Tent setup is the biggest headache of camping for a lot of campers, but luckily a lot of tents now come with options to make that setup process easier! Some tents have color coded setups, where the sockets that attach to the tent poles are different colors, and the ends of the tent poles that correspond to the individual socket match the color of the socket where they are supposed to go. Often the clips to attach the rainfly will also be color coded so that it’s easy to toss the rainfly on quickly if it starts storming. A lot of tents available today also have what’s called a quick clip pitch system. Instead of the old days of threading the tent poles through a sleeve on the tent, the quick clip system just consists of plastic clips on the body of the tent that can easily attach to the poles once the poles are in their socket. It makes it much faster to set the tent up without the need to fidget with pole sleeves.

## How to Choose the Right 2-Person Tent for You

Now that you have a better understanding of what’s out there in terms of types of 2-person tents and features in 2-person tents, let’s take a look at a few examples of Curated customers who I have personally helped to find the right 2-person tents for their situation. For each camper, I have listed a bit of information about what they’re looking for, some features that would be helpful for them, and three of the best 2-person tents for their camping needs!

### Emma, the Weekend Wilderness Explorer

Emma enjoys weekend hiking and camping trips with a friend or partner. She hops between backpacking and car camping and camps in all kinds of weather from hot summer days to chilly fall days so she wants a tent that can work for both. Emma is looking for a balance between comfort and practicality in her camping gear, seeking a tent that's easy to carry on the trail yet comfortable enough for 2 people to hang out in if it’s rainy or they need to relax after a long hike.

Features Emma should look for:

- Moderate weight for easier carrying
- Simple setup and takedown.
- Good ventilation for varied weather conditions.

### Daniel, the Solo-Plus Adventurer

Daniel often does solo backpacking trips but also likes having the option to accommodate a friend, so rather than just going for a one-person tent, he wants something with enough space for a friend. He prefers remote campsites that require long distance hikes in technical terrain. He’s all in on the ultralight backpacking trend, so doesn’t mind spending a bit of extra money for a tent that’s lightweight, durable, and adaptable to various climates and environments.

Features to Look For:

- High-quality, lightweight materials like Silnylon or Dyneema.
- A sturdy pole system for stability in high winds
- A minimalist design to reduce weight.
- Ultra-lightweight
- Sturdy construction to withstand harsh weather

### Claire, the Family-Friendly Car Camper

Claire loves car camping with her partner and occasionally her young child. When their child goes with them, it’s a full time job keeping an eye on him around the campsite, so she wants a tent that has an intuitive setup. Claire also wants something that’s spacious, and comfortable for hassle-free camping trips that her child enjoys.

Features to Look For:

- A dome-style design for increased headroom.
- Heavy-duty materials for longevity.
- Extra features like vestibules for gear storage outside so the inside of the tent doesn’t feel cramped
- Spacious interior and high ceiling for 2+ people
