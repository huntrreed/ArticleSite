title: '8-Person Tents: How to Choose the Right One for You'
---

Tl;DR\:Choosing the right 8-person tent requires a clear understanding of your needs and expectations. Whether you're a family-oriented camper needing comfort and space, a festival-goer looking for ease and convenience, or an all-terrain camper seeking resilience and durability, identifying your camping style is the first step. From there, you can hone in on what features, type of tent, and other considerations you want to account for!

My name is Hunter, and I’ve worked in the outdoor industry for 8 years, as well as been an avid camper for about 22 now. As a kid, my dad ensured he shared his love of camping with me so that I continued to go on tons of camping trips as an adult. I have done just about every kind of camping in every kind of weather, from greuling backpacking in snow, to car camping with a huge group. I’ve tried and tested tons of gear, with tents being no exception. Though nowadays I usually camp with my 3-person tent, I have an 8-person tent that has seen plenty of use and been a lifesaver for some trips.

Generally, I’ve noticed that most campers don’t see the purpose in an 8-person tent unless they have a larger family. But the truth is, there are plenty of other reasons to get an 8-person tent! In this guide, I’ll go over some reasons you might want to purchase an 8-person tent. We’ll also cover the types of questions to ask yourself before purchasing, different types of 8-person tents on the market, and some key features to look for!

## What Is an 8-Person Tent, and Do I Need One?

An 8-person tent is a portable shelter designed to sleep up to eight campers. Whether you actually have 8 campers or a few less than that, there are tons of reasons you might want to get an 8-person tent over something smaller! Here are a few common scenarios in which you may want an 8-person tent:

### Families

8-person tents are great for families, especially with younger kids. When my younger brother was 8, he wanted to camp in his own tent, so my dad and I would sleep in one tent and let him sleep in his own tent next to us. Inevitably, he would wake up scared and come sleep with us. When he was younger, he would need to sleep in a tent with us, but with a smaller tent it was hard to avoid waking him up when we went to sleep a bit later. 8-person tents solve this problem, because if a child is younger, they can sleep in a separate area of the 8-person tent to avoid waking them. When an 8-year-old wants his own space to camp, it’s easy to give him his own room in a multi-room tent so he still feels independent, but not scared.

### Inviting New Campers

Throughout college, I went on lots of camping trips with newer campers. Having a larger tent allowed me to share my sleeping space so my friends without tents had somewhere to sleep, without needing to invest money in their own tent. Having extra space like this is a great way to get new friends into camping, and the extra interior space will make them feel comfortable—almost like they are sleeping in a cabin on their first few trips, which makes for a great introduction to camping!

### Groups

An 8-person tent can be a nice option for groups. It gives you a communal area to hang out in, especially if there’s bad weather outside. I’ve had plenty of camping trips where not everyone is sharing my 8-person tent, but because of the extra floor space I have compared to the 2- or 3-man tents my friends are in, everyone ends up coming to my 8-person tent to play cards or drink beer. If I don’t have my 8-person tent and it’s rainy, people tend to hang out in their own tents, which can be a bummer if you were really looking forward to spending time together.

### Long-term Camping

A few years back, I hit the road for a 2+ month camping trip where I was living out of my truck. I would generally stay at a campsite for about a week, so I brought along a tent for extra storage and better organization. It was helpful to be able to throw things like clothes into a separate space, so my life wasn’t a constant game of reorganizing. There were also plenty of rainy days where I wanted to stay dry, and having a separate space was nice for stretching out. With a friend or partner, a roomy tent like an 8-person is a fabulous choice to get some extra space or store some essentials on long-term camping trips.

There are a ton of great reasons to get a larger tent like 8-person. They do, of course, have some downfalls, such as not being great for backpacking, and being a bit noisier and less sturdy in strong winds, so deciding whether or not an 8-person tent is the right choice for you depends on your situation.

For most campers, I recommend starting off with a 3- or 4-person tent, since they are a bit more versatile in terms of the kind of camping trips you can bring them on (backpacking as well as car camping), they stay a bit warmer with smaller groups sleeping in them, and they are more compact and easy to setup. But for any avid camper who typically camps with a few friends or family, an 8-person tent is a great second tent to have.

## What to Consider When Buying an 8-Person Tent

There are a few things to think about when figuring out what you need in an 8-person tent. Here are the first questions to mull over before you start the process of honing in on the right tent for you:

### What kind of camping are you planning on doing?

The first step is to get clear on the type of camping you’re going to be doing. Are you planning a low-key family camping trip where you might want a lot of space or room dividers? Are you going on long camping trips in more extreme environments, where weather protection might be the priority? The type of camping you’re doing will be the main decider on what kind of features and materials you want in your tent.

### What kind of weather do you anticipate?

Eight-person tents are generally a bit taller than 2-4 person tents. This can make them more susceptible to damage or swaying if you’ll be camping someplace that’s super windy. If you anticipate camping in windy areas, look for an 8-person tent that is a bit shorter, so it can stay more stable in high winds. If you expect to camp in rain or snow, make sure you get a tent that’s appropriate for those conditions. Campers who typically stay in rainy areas might want a more robust rain fly, with heavier duty waterproofing and more guylines that they can stake out to keep the rain out more effectively. If you’re winter camping, look for a 4-season tent that’s sturdy enough to keep you warm and protected in snowstorms. Alternatively, if you’re using your 8-person tent for casual summer camping trips, search for a tent that has enough windows and ventilation to keep everyone cool throughout the night!

### What kind of ventilation and layout are you looking for?

Eight bodies sleeping in one tent can create a lot of body heat. If you’re camping in a colder climate, that might be nice. But for summer camping, it can make for a sleepless night of trying to stay cool. Many 8-person tents have a taller ceiling which allows more air to flow in and out of the tent, keeping it cooler at night. Another key thing to look at is the window and door situation. Mesh windows, mesh doors, or even a mesh roof will help keep the bugs out, while letting cool air flow in. A tent with enough ventilation is key to making sure everyone in the tent gets a good night’s sleep and is ready for the next day’s adventure.

The layout of the tent is just as important as the ventilation capabilities. Some 8-person tents are just a single room, while others have room dividers. If you’re camping with young kids who need to go to bed before the adults, room dividers are a lifesaver. You’ll be able to put the kids to bed in one room, and not worry about waking them up when you go to bed later on in the evening. Even if you’re camping with a group of friends, it’s likely that people will want to go to bed or wake up at different times, so it’s nice to have this feature. Room dividers can also provide some privacy if any of the campers in your group need to change clothes, or even just want some alone time to wind down after a big hike.

### How easy is the tent to setup?

Before actually purchasing a tent, do some research on the setup process for the tent you’re considering. Larger tents are never as straightforward to set up as most smaller tents are. Some tents this size are a 2- or 3-person job, and if you’re primarily camping with younger children, that might make it really difficult to set your tent up! Most tents come with features that are intended to help this setup process be less of a headache, such as color coded poles or clip-on attachments on the poles.

### How much should an 8-person tent cost?

Price tags for 8-person tents can vary quite a bit depending on what kind of tent you’re looking for.

- Low end (around $150)\:These are generally not as feature-heavy, and not intended to withstand harsh weather. If you’re just doing casual fair-weather camping and don’t want to break the bank, they can totally check all the boxes.
- Mid-range ($200-700): Can vary quite a bit in features and price. Here, you’ll find tents with different layouts, features, setup situations, and ventilation capabilities. This is the best match for the majority of campers, because they’ll offer enough weather protection for any unexpected storms, will be considerably more durable than a low-price point tent, and won’t have too many features that will be a pain to setup.
- Higher-end (around $1000)\:These are for the camper that is really looking to go fancy, or is planning on doing some winter camping. Tents in this price range usually aren’t as well ventilated because they are intended for more rugged use, but they will last a long time and generally pack up to be pretty small without weighing as much as mid- or low-price range tents.

Figuring out how much exactly you need to spend varies quite a bit depending on what kind of camping you’re doing, so answering that first question will give you a better idea of how much to budget for when shopping for an 8-person tent.

## What Are the Different Types of 8-Person Tents?

Not all 8-person tents are created equal, and there are different styles to suit different camping needs. Let’s take a look at the different types of 8-person tents you’ll encounter when shopping.

### Cabin Tent

Cabin-style tents are shaped like—you guessed it—a cabin! They are large and roomy, with a high ceiling and vertical walls. An 8-person cabin tent has more space than the classic dome or tunnel-style tents, which make them a great option for those who prioritize comfort and don’t expect to run into much weather on their camping trips.

Benefits:

- High ceilings and a lot of space inside, making them comfortable for standing or hanging out for long periods of time
- Generally, they’ll include at least one room divider curtain for privacy
- Usually have large windows for ventilation, and the higher ceiling allows more air to be trapped inside the tent, keeping things cooler at night

Be Aware:

- Heavier than other styles of 8-person tents
- The straight walls don’t handle heavy wind or rain as well as a shorter, more curved tent
- More complex to setup, and typically require more than one adult for the setup process

### Dome Tents

A dome tent is the classic tent shape that most of us think about. They have a curved shape on top, and while they can be different shapes and sizes, generally there is not enough internal headroom to stand. The curved top of these tents is usually caused by two or more poles intersecting, which increases the overall stability of the tent.

Benefits:

- Good resistance to wind and rain
- Dome tents don’t typically require more than one person for the setup process
- Good balance between space and weather performance for campers who want to be comfy, but are traveling to areas with unpredictable weather
- Usually lighter-weight than cabin tents

Be Aware:

- Lower ceilings, so less living space than cabin tents
- Can’t handle extreme inclement weather as well as tunnel or geodesic tents can

### Tunnel Tents

Tunnel tents have hoop-shaped poles which, when set up, result in a tunnel-shaped tent. This shape is great for overall stability in bad weather conditions. They typically have a door on each side of the tunnel, and an awning outside of the tent that serves as a kind of a “porch area” where you can store gear.

Benefits:

- Good wind, rain, and even light snow resistance
- Awning area allows for extra storage space that keeps your gear protected, without the need to take up internal room

Be Aware:

- More complicated to set up
- Typically not great ventilation capabilities
- Heavier

### Instant or Pop-up Tents

If quick and easy setup is your priority, these are for you. Instant tents or pop-up tents usually have spring-loaded setup, which just requires you to unfold them and extend the poles. Though 8-person instant tents or pop-up tents aren’t the most durable or great for variable weather, they allow you to minimize your camp setup time and maximize your time exploring outdoors.

Benefits:

- Extremely easy and fast to set up
- More spacious inside than dome or tunnel style tents
- Depending on the material, can be super durable. Most pop up tents are made of canvas, which lasts a long time when cared for properly.

Be Aware:

- Lack stability in windier conditions, and not designed for keeping out heavy rain
- Not as well ventilated as other tent styles
- Heavy, and can be a pain to pack up or transport to and from the car

### Geodesic and Semi-Geodesic Tents

Almost like dome tents on steroids, geodesic and semi-geodesic have the same curved top as dome tents, but with more poles. The extra poles end up forming a triangle pattern, which keeps the tent super stable in snow or heavy rains and winds. Most geodesic and semi-geodesic tents are intended for four-season camping, because they are the most stable and insulated of all the tent options.

Benefits:

- Bad weather? No problem. Exceptional stability in snow or high winds.
- Made out of very durable materials that will last a long time
- Since a lot of geodesic or semi-geodesic tents are intended for mountaineering expeditions, they are more lightweight than most other styles of 8-person tents

Be Aware:

- More complex setup
- The most expensive option out there
- Not the best ventilation capabilities, since they are designed more with weather performance in mind

## Features to Look Out for When Buying an 8-Person Tent

Let’s go over a few features to look for when shopping for your 8-person tent. Not all of these might be relevant to your exact situation, but it’s helpful to understand what your options are!

### Weather Resistance

No matter what kind of camping you’re planning on doing, weather resistance is a great feature to have. Even if you expect it to be sunny the whole time you’re camping, weather can be unpredictable. Having a heavy-duty rainfly on your tent will save you and your tentmates from a restless night of getting soaked or worrying about wet gear for your morning hike.

### Ventilation

Ventilation is also an important feature in any tent. It’s especially necessary in 8-person tents, because 8 bodies sleeping in a tent can make it warm up pretty quickly! Having multiple windows or mesh doors throughout the tent is a great way to ensure you all stay cool enough to sleep well.

### Easy Setup Features

Some tents have color-coded poles and clips to make the setup more intuitive. When dealing with a large 8-person tent, setup can be pretty cumbersome, so any help you can get from the tent design is a plus! Some tents will also have clip-on poles, which allow clips on the outside of the tent body to easily clip into the poles (as opposed to the classic poles which go through a section of the fabric), which helps make setup quicker and easier!

### High Quality Zippers

A broken zipper on a tent is a bummer. Not only might it mean that you need to replace your tent, but it can leave you with a hole in your tent door on your trip, allowing bugs and critters to get inside. Look for larger, high-quality zippers on your tent doors. With 8 people entering and exiting your tent, the zippers will get a lot of use, so set yourself up for success by getting a tent with high-quality zippers right off the bat!

### Room Dividers

We’ve talked about this a bit already, but internal room dividers in your tent are great for families or groups sharing a tent because it allows a bit of privacy within your tent for changing clothes or sleeping. It’s super helpful to have this if some people in the group have different bedtimes, so that you don’t accidentally shine your headlamp on your sleeping tentmates and wake them up! With room dividers, anyone going to bed at different times can sleep in separate rooms.

### Storage Space and Organization

8 people and 8 sets of gear can be a lot to store in a tent! Any organization or storage features such as pockets, loops, or a gear loft are super helpful for staying organized.

### Expanded Vestibules

Many 8-person tents have expanded vestibules on the sides of the tent. These can serve a few helpful purposes:

- You can store some gear or shoes outside under the vestibule and rest assured that they will be protected from any rain.
- They give you a place to hang out that’s outside of the tent, but still offers some protection from rain or harsh sun. Most 8-person tents are big enough that the vestibule will be large enough to set up a camp chair or two, which makes for a great place to hang out!

### Footprint

Some tents come with a footprint, and some tents have it sold separately. A footprint is a piece of material that goes underneath your tent prior to pitching it. It prolongs the life of your tent by helping to protect the floor from rips and holes, and giving you an extra layer of protection from the ground. This is a great thing to have in any tent, but especially an 8-person tent which will see a lot more people coming in and out of the tent and moving around inside the tent.

### No-See-Um Mesh

This mesh is generally over the doors and windows. It has small holes which prevents even tiny bugs from getting in the tent, but still gives you good airflow for excellent ventilation.

### Reflective Guylines and Zippers

Guylines help stake out the outside walls of the tent in order to provide more stability to the structure. This is especially important in larger tents such as 8-person tents, which will benefit from the added sturdiness. Reflective guylines are much easier to see in the dark, so if you are moving around outside the tent, you’re less likely to trip on the guylines. Reflective zippers prevent you from fumbling around to zip and unzip the tent in the dark, which is nice when you’re trying to be extra quiet or fast going in and out to prevent bugs from getting inside.
