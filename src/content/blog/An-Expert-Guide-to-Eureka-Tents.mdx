title: An Expert Guide to Eureka Tents
---

TL;DR\:When considering the purchase of a Eureka tent, consider the purpose of the tent, the size you need, and what kind of weather you plan on primarily camping in. From there, you can hone in on the right type of tent and any use-specific features that can help make your camping trip seamless and easy.

I’ve been an avid camper all my life, and having worked in the outdoor world for going on seven years now, I have a pretty broad knowledge of different camping-related brands and stay up to date on new technologies and gear in the outdoor world.

Eureka was a brand I hadn’t heard of until I started working in this industry, which was surprising the further I dug into their gear. They have one of the most interesting stories of any outdoor brand, and thanks to their roots, they make some of the sturdiest and most durable tents on the market. In this guide, I’ll walk you through everything you need to know about their tent options so that you can find the perfect Eureka tent for you!

## Who is Eureka?

Compared to other outdoor brands, Eureka has quite a unique origin story. In 1895, they started making wagon covers, horse blankets, and awnings out of a small building in upstate New York. When World War II broke out in the 1940s, they expanded and started focusing their skills on making canvas tents for the armed forces. After the war was over, they started shifting into their current identity of being an outdoor-focused brand, branching out from exclusively canvas tents into the different polyester and nylon materials you see today. All this to say, Eureka has a long history of adaptation and progression. Today, they are still best known for their camping tents, though they have a few other products, such as camp cookware, camping stoves, and camp furniture. Their tents are their longest-standing product to date, and in this article, we will focus on their different tent options!

## Key Considerations When Buying a Eureka Tent

Before we jump into specifics on Eureka’s tent lineup, it’s useful to think about a few general questions to narrow down exactly what you need from your tent.

### What kind of camping are you doing?

First and foremost, you’ll want to know[what kind of camping trips](https://www.curated.com/journal/6000/what-are-the-different-types-of-tents?ref=journal)you’re planning on going on so that you can get a tent that is well-suited to those needs. If you’re backpacking, you’ll need a tent that’s light and compact for easy carrying over long distances. If you tend to do more casual family car camping trips, space and comfort will be more of a priority.

### How many people will be sleeping in the tent?

Eureka has a range of[tent sizes](https://www.curated.com/journal/756000/what-size-tent-do-i-need?ref=journal), from smaller[2-person tents](https://www.curated.com/journal/3165000/2-person-tents-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you?ref=journal)all the way to large[12-person](https://www.curated.com/products/2891962/eureka-copper-canyon-lx-12-tent?ref=journal)cabin-style tents. 2-person tents are great for yourself and one more camper or for just yourself if you want to have some extra room in the tent. If you have a larger group and need to sleep ten people or more, a 12-person tent would fit your needs.

Even if you only have five or so campers who are sleeping in the tent but you want extra space to hang out inside if the weather is bad, a larger 12-person tent might be a good fit. Some of the larger tents come with more than one room inside, which makes them a popular option for parents who want their kids to have a separate area to sleep so they can go to bed earlier without worrying that they'll wake up when the adults go to bed.

### What weather do you plan on camping in?

Some Eureka tents fare better in[high wind or heavy rain](https://www.curated.com/journal/1095001/how-to-stay-dry-and-comfortable-when-camping-in-the-rain?ref=journal)than others. If you find yourself camping in a lot of rough weather, get a tent that is stable in the wind and has extra weather reinforcement (such as taped seams, a bathtub floor, or a full-coverage rainfly). More of a[fair-weather camper](https://www.curated.com/journal/2735000/how-to-stay-cool-when-camping-in-the-summer?ref=journal)? Make sure you get a tent that has adequate ventilation so you and your teammates don't overheat on warm summer evenings! Even if you don't expect rain on your camping trip, make sure to always bring a rainfly with you so that if any unexpected storms roll in, you can keep yourself and your gear well-protected and dry!

### Are there any other features that would be particularly useful to your camping situation?

We'll talk a bit more about specific features later in this article, but this is also a good time to think about what features in a tent might be useful to you. Some Eureka tents have extra reinforced floors to protect from sharp[dog claws](https://www.curated.com/journal/619000/the-best-tents-for-camping-with-your-dog?ref=journal), while others have E-ports to make it easy to run a cord from your car or generator inside the tent to power or[charge electronics](https://www.curated.com/journal/2171000/how-to-have-electricity-when-camping?ref=journal). Consider any special needs you might want in a tent so you can find one that checks all the boxes!

### How much do you want to spend?

Eureka has a ton of tent options that keep you well-sheltered during your camping trips without draining your bank account. If you aren't looking to spend a ton of money, a basic tent from Eureka can range from $100 to $200.

If you want something bigger or with more features, a mid-range option will be closer to $200 to $350. Mid-range is generally the most popular option for casual campers who want something reliable but don't care about all the extra bells and whistles.

The most expensive, top-tier Eureka tents are closer to $350 to $550, and these tend to be really large, packed with features and have top-of-the-line weather protection technology. The high-end tents are generally overkill for most casual campers, but if you are an avid camper who spends a lot of time sleeping under the stars, these are totally worth the investment as they will last a long time and give you peace of mind that your shelter will keep you dry during any kind of weather Mother Nature throws at you.

## Types of Eureka Tents

Eureka has a few different types of tents to suit different camping needs. Here are the four different types of tents Eureka makes and a few pros and cons of each type!

### [Car Camping Tents](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/b/eureka/f-tent-use-case/camping?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)

The most basic and best budget option is Eureka's line of car camping tents. These are intended for the casual and occasional campers who don't need to consider the weight of the tent in their decision. They are larger and more spacious than backpacking tents and have more feature options. Many Eureka car camping tents are cabin-style tents, meaning the walls are nearly vertical, the interior peak height is tall enough to stand up in, and they have a larger floor area compared to smaller, shorter dome-style tents.

Benefits:

- Least expensive options
- More comfortable and spacious than backpacking tents
- Several feature options

Be Aware:

- Too heavy to carry in a backpack
- Not as compact as some other tents

### [Backpacking Tents](https://www.curated.com/c/tents/b/eureka/f-tent-use-case/backpacking?sort=relevance&source=srp-facets&ref=journal)

If you’re planning on camping at sites that require you to hike in, a backpacking tent would be the go-to option. They have less fancy features than car camping tents, but they are exceptionally durable, light, and compact to make it easy to pack in your backpacking bag.

Benefits:

- Versatile, since you can use them for car camping or backpacking
- Lightest and most compact option
- Durable for more extreme weather conditions

Be Aware:

- More expensive than car camping tents
- Less roomy inside compared to car camping tents

### Scouting and Outfitting Tents

Eureka also has two unique lines of tents called 'scouting tents' and 'outfitting tents.' Both of these are pretty similar in that they are heavier-duty car camping tents meant for extended and frequent use, such as at a scout camp or with a youth group. They typically have extra features like a reinforced frame and extra durable floors or oversized zippers. Scouting tents, in particular, are a great option for camping with kids since kids can be hard on gear without realizing it and because they are easier to set up, which can both save you time and give you a good opportunity to teach younger folks the basics of how to set up a tent and campsite on their own.

Benefits:

- More youth-friendly design so kids can learn and be more involved in the camp setup process
- More durable than car camping or backpacking tents

Be Aware:

- More expensive than classic car camping tents
- Typically pretty heavy, so not a good option for backpacking

## Features to Look for in Eureka Tents

Eureka has some unique features and technologies in their tents that, depending on your exact tent-use situation, might be useful for you! All of these may not apply, but it’s helpful to understand the terms and technology in Eureka’s tents to find the right tent that fits your needs.

- StormShield Fabric\:StormShield is Eureka's unique weather-resistant material. It's super durable and has a high waterproof rating and a durable water-repellent coating on top of the waterproofing for extra protection. If you're camping in areas that tend to get a lot of rain, this is a must-have in your Eureka tent!
- Hi/Low Vent\:Eureka's special high/low venting system allows for more adjustable airflow than is normally found in tents, which is helpful both for warm summer nights of camping when you need to cool off and for colder frigid nights when you want to avoid condensation buildup inside the tent. It consists of small vents on the top of the rainfly that are angled to allow water to drip down the tent instead of in the tent while still allowing air to get in and out of the tent easily. These vents can be propped open with small fiberglass poles that are sewn into the rainfly, or they can be velcroed closed when you want the vents shut.
- E!Luminate System\:Most tents have gear loops to store your headlamp or lantern in so you can have some light to read or organize inside the tent when it's dark out. With the E!Luminate system for Eureka, this gear loop is surrounded by reflective (removable) panels, which reflect the light from your headlamp or lantern, making your tent a bit brighter and more well-lit.

- E!Media Center\:This feature in Eureka tents is great for anyone who wants to watch something on a phone or iPad while in the tent or even for those who just want a secure place to store these things so they are out of the way inside the tent. It's an extended gear loft with three storage pockets, and the middle pocket is zippered and large enough to stow an iPad or similar tablet. When the tablet is in the E!Media center, it is facing down, making it easy to lay down in your sleeping bag and watch your movies or shows on the screen above you.

- V3 Enhanced System\:The V3 stands for "volume, venting, and versatility," and the V3 system in Eureka tents increases the internal space of the tent while also adding some ventilation capabilities. It consists of a vertical strut pole in the vestibule of the tent, which allows you to securely store your gear outside of the tent under the vestibule where it can still be protected from weather. On the vestibule, there are hooded fly vents that increase airflow in and out of the vestibule to avoid condensation buildup inside the tent when the rainfly is closed but are angled in a way that any rainfall will drip outside of the vestibule, away from your gear as opposed to getting inside via the open vent. This system is included in most of Eureka's backpacking tents and is a great way to ensure your gear stays dry without the need to cram it into your sleeping quarters.
