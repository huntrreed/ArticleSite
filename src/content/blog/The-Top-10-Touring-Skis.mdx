title: The Top 10 Touring Skis
---

Backcountry skiing opens a world of limitless possibilities compared to your local resort's classic crowded ski runs. The right touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)can be your trusted companions, unlocking the full potential of these snowy landscapes.

In this article, we'll explore the top 10 touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that combine lightweight performance, versatility, and durability. From exploring untouched powder bowls to conquering challenging terrains, these[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are meticulously crafted to elevate your backcountry experiences. So, gear up and get ready to discover the[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that will take your adventures to new heights.

## What Makes Touring[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)Different Than Resort[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)?

Touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are designed for backcountry skiing, as in any skiing done outside the boundaries of a ski area. In contrast, resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are designed for skiing in ski areas.

### Weight

Touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically lighter than resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)and commonly made from light materials such as carbon fiber or poplar wood, making them easier to carry uphill. Backcountry skiers often travel long distances and climb steep terrain, so they need[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that are low in weight and easy to maneuver. However, resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically heavier than touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), giving them more stability at high speeds and on hard snow.

### Bindings

Touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have bindings that allow the heel to lift off the ski. This is important for backcountry skiers because it allows them to walk and climb without taking their[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)off. In addition, touring bindings are typically lighter and more flexible than resort bindings, making them more comfortable for walking and climbing.

On the other hand, resort bindings will keep your heel locked in place and are generally heavier and more burly. Since resort skiing doesn’t require you to walk up steep inclines with your bindings, the heavier and burlier design of resort bindings makes for a safer ride, especially on icy or packed-out trails, as you typically find at resorts.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing Touring[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

A few quick factors to mention when looking for touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)before we get into our list of top touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)!

### 1. Weight: Lighter Is Better

As mentioned above, when it comes to touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), weight is a crucial element to consider. Trekking up the skin track to the top of a steep mountain in the backcountry can be exhausting, so the less weight you carry, the better. For this reason, touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are designed to be quite a bit lighter than regular resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). (Usually around 3-4lbs per ski for touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)and closer to 6-8lbs per ski for resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal).) It’s also a bit of a balancing game because although you want a lightweight ski for the uphill, getting something that doesn’t compromise on strength or durability is important to have a stable, fun ride down still.

Touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically made from a mixture of the following materials:

- Carbon fiber\:Carbon fiber is a high-performance material in some of the lightest and most responsive[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Carbon fiber provides excellent strength and stiffness, ideal for hard snow and fast skiing. Carbon fiber[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically the lightest and most expensive type of ski.
- Bamboo\:Bamboo is a strong and lightweight material frequently used with other materials to create durable and responsive[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Bamboo[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically lighter than wood[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)but not as durable. Bamboo is also a renewable resource, making it a more sustainable option than other materials.
- Ash\:Ash is a strong and durable wood often used to construct[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Ash[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically heavier than wood[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)but are also more durable. Ash is a traditional material for[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)and is still used in many high-end models.
- Paulownia\:Paulownia is a lightweight wood used to create touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Paulownia[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically lighter than other types of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), but they are not as durable.
- Karuba\:Karura is a strong and durable wood used to construct touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Karura[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are typically heavier than other types of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), but they are also more durable. Karura is a relatively new material for[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), but it is quickly gaining popularity due to its strength and durability.

### 2. Width and Flexibility

Touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)come in various widths, each designed for specific conditions and terrains. A wider ski offers better floatation in deep snow, providing a more exhilarating experience when you venture off-piste. On the other hand, a narrower ski excels in firm snow conditions or narrower areas such as couloirs since they offer enhanced edge control and maneuverability.

Flexibility is another consideration to think about, as it will vary across touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Many touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are made with carbon, which keeps things light and responsive, but also makes the ski quite a bit stiffer. If you are skiing narrower, tighter terrain—something that’s a bit less stiff—it will be easier to turn. But if you are primarily looking to ski big powder lines, open bowls, and soft snow, a stiffer ski might not be as much of a problem. The right stiffness will also depend on other factors, such as your skill level and weight. A lighter or newer skier will have difficulty turning a stiff, full-carbon ski. In contrast, a heavier, expert skier can control a stiffer ski easier, making this less of an issue. If you have questions regarding what kind of stiffness would be right for you,reach out to a Skiing Expert here on Curated, and we would be happy to help advise you on this!

### 3. Binding and Climbing Skin Compatibility

Lastly, a huge difference between touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)and resort[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)is that touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)must handle a touring binding and accommodate climbing[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)(which attach to the bottom of your ski for the walk-up). Most[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)work with climbing skins, it’s just a matter of ensuring you get the correct size skin. But some[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have features such as notched tails that allow climbing skins to work more flawlessly with the ski and stay in place better on long ascents.

As for bindings, touring bindings have a walk mode that allows the heel of your boots to come up, making it easier to walk. Also, lighter[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)tend to work better with lighter touring bindings, whereas heavier ones might need something more burly. If you already have a binding in mind when shopping for a touring ski, make sure the ski you purchase will work well with that binding to provide optimal control and a smooth ride on the descent.
Now that we have those considerations covered, let’s dive into our list of top touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal).

## Top 10 Touring[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

### 1.[DPS Pagoda Tour 106 C2](https://www.curated.com/products/4678293/dps-pagoda-106-c2-skis-2022-163-cm?ref=journal)

Though most brands have a range of both resort and backcountry ski options, DPS is most well-known for its backcountry[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). The DPS Pagoda 106 C2 is the most popular of their backcountry[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), as it delivers a harmonious blend of lightweight performance and stability. This ski is well-suited for advanced skiers seeking a versatile option that excels in various conditions, from deep powder to mixed terrain. Its construction incorporates DPS's innovative Pagoda technology, featuring a combination of carbon, bamboo, and ash materials. The carbon fiber enhances responsiveness and agility, while the bamboo and ash layers provide a dampening effect, absorbing vibrations for a smoother ride.

### 2.[Black Diamond Helio Carbon 95](https://www.curated.com/products/6379201/black-diamond-helio-carbon-95-skis-2025-155-cm?ref=journal)

###

The Black Diamond Helio Carbon 95 is a go-to choice for fast and light ski-touring adventures. With a paulownia wood core and a pre-preg carbon fiber layup, this ski is designed to be incredibly lightweight without compromising on performance. The carbon construction enhances torsional stiffness, allowing for precise edge control and responsiveness. Ideal for the experienced backcountry skier who values speed and efficiency, the Helio 95 effortlessly glides uphill and confidently carves turns on the descents. It is a bit narrower than many other touring[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)with a 95mm waist width, so if you’re mainly looking for a cruiser ski to find powder with, you will want something wider!

### 3.[Blizzard Zero G 105](https://www.curated.com/products/5489689/blizzard-zero-g-105-skis-2025-172-cm?ref=journal)

###

Arguably the most versatile ski on this list, the Blizzard Zero G 105 strikes a perfect balance between lightweight construction and downhill performance. Its construction consists of a carbon frame and a paulownia wood core, resulting in a lightweight yet durable ski. The carbon frame keeps the Zero G relatively stiff, providing stability and power transmission on descents. Still, the paulownia keeps it a bit more playful and less demanding than a full carbon ski. As a result, this ski excels in a wide range of conditions, making it suitable for adventurous skiers who like a little bit of everything, from steep couloirs to open powder fields.

### 4.[Black Crows Navis Freebird](https://www.curated.com/products/6384019/black-crows-navis-freebird-touring-skis-2025-179-cm?ref=journal)

###

Another company known primarily for its backcountry[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), the Black Crows Navis Freebird is a touring ski designed to conquer deep snow and challenging backcountry terrain. It is an excellent choice for experienced skiers who crave the freedom to explore off-piste, providing confidence and agility in powder-filled adventures. Constructed with a lightweight paulownia wood core and carbon reinforcement, it delivers a blend of responsiveness and stability. The carbon reinforcement adds strength, ensuring precise control in demanding conditions, while the paulownia keeps things light and maneuverable when turning in tight spots such as trees or couloirs.

### 5.[Faction Agent 3](https://www.curated.com/products/6414455/faction-agent-3-skis-2024-172-cm?ref=journal)

###

Toeing the line between the backcountry ski and freeride ski categories, the Faction Agent 3 is a backcountry ski built for those who want something agile and surfy. With a hybrid balsa flax core and carbon reinforcement, this ski offers a lively and playful feel while maintaining stability at high speeds. The balsa flax core provides a lightweight and responsive platform, while the carbon reinforcement gives the skier optimal edge control. Whether you're touring through mixed conditions or exploring steep lines, the Faction Agent 3 is a reliable choice for intermediate to advanced skiers looking for a well-rounded performer that can handle variable snow, hucking cliffs, or fresh powder lines.

### 6.[Moment Wildcat Tour 108](https://www.curated.com/products/6379174/moment-wildcat-tour-108-skis-2023-174-cm?ref=journal)

The Wildcat Tour 108 is the weapon of choice for aggressive skiers who enjoy charging down steep descents and seeking out the untouched powder, making it a reliable companion for thrilling backcountry missions.

### 7.[Salomon MTN Explore 88](https://www.curated.com/products/5224455/salomon-mtn-explore-88-women-s-light-blue-tq-skis-153-cm?ref=journal)

###

For skiers who gravitate towards long ascents and technical descents and have goals of dabbling in ski mountaineering, the Salomon MTN Explore 88 is a great option. Constructed with a karuba wood core and carbon fiber reinforcement, it offers a winning combination of lightweight performance and stability. The narrow waist width of the Explore 88 keeps it maneuverable with precise edge control in tighter areas and more variable snow (not as much of a powder ski as the wider options on this list). In addition, its karuba wood core provides a lively and responsive feel, while the carbon stringers keep it stiff enough to feel stable no matter the technical terrain you’re in.

The MTN Explore is perfect for ambitious skiers who prioritize uphill efficiency and want a ski that can confidently handle challenging descents. Keep in mind that it’s not the best option for those mainly getting into touring to ski big powder lines.

### 8.[Volkl Rise Above 88](https://www.curated.com/products/7195668/voelkl-rise-above-88-skis-2024-170-cm?ref=journal)

###

The Volkl Blaze 106 is more of a freeride-oriented backcountry ski that thrives in deep powder. It offers a powerful and responsive ride, constructed with a multi-layer wood core and carbon reinforcement.

The Blaze 106 is best suited for advanced skiers seeking a playful and dynamic ski that can confidently handle aggressive descents and deep snow.

### 10.[Voile Hypercharger](https://www.curated.com/products/8509189/voile-hypercharger-skis-171-cm?ref=journal)

###

For do-it-all skiers who want to get into a little bit of every kind of terrain, the Voile Hypercharger is a versatile option that will offer reliable performance no matter what you’re skiing. Its construction features a lightweight paulownia wood core, carbon and fiberglass reinforcement, and a durable polyamide topsheet. The paulownia wood core provides a responsive and lively feel, while the carbon and fiberglass reinforcement adds strength and stability. As a result, the Hypercharger is an excellent choice for backcountry skiers who value a ski that can handle various conditions, from powder-filled bowls to technical couloirs.

## Safety First

As you embark on your backcountry ski journey, it is essential to remember that safety should always be at the forefront of your mind. Before venturing into the backcountry:

1. Make sure you equip yourself with the necessary knowledge and skills.
2. Take an avalanche class to understand the risks and learn how to mitigate them.
3. Familiarize yourself with the proper use of safety equipment, including a beacon, shovel, and probe.

These tools can be a lifeline in an emergency, ensuring you are prepared for the unexpected.
