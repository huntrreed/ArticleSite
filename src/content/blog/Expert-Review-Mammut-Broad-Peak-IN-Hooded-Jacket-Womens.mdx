About this Review\:This review is my honest opinion of the jacket, which I purchased with my own money in December of 2022.

## My take

The Mammut Broad Peak IN Hooded Jacket is a really warm, down-insulated jacket that keeps me toasty on even the coldest days, but doesn’t feel overly puffy and heavy like many similar warmth jackets do. It feels incredibly versatile as just a day-to-day jacket in the winter, a midlayer during cold ski days, or as a main layer during colder hikes/runs/climbing days.

## How it performs

## What I was looking for

At the time of purchasing this jacket, I was looking for a warm, down puffy to use for a midlayer skiing and as a day-to-day jacket in the winter. I had a Patagonia HILoft Down Jacket, which is similarly warm, but a little too puffy and it makes me feel like the Michelin Man. I would never wear it as a midlayer skiing because it is too puffy, and it is also just too bulky to wear on the day to day in winter. I wanted something that was super warm, but still lightweight enough that did not feel restricted in movement or like a marshmallow.

## Why I chose this gear

I chose this particular product because I had heard good things about Mammut products, I knew they specialized in mountaineering sort of products (a little more technical than a lot of other brands, since mountaineering jackets tend to pack the most warmth for the lightest weight). Since I wanted something super warm, but light and somewhat breathable (since I was going to be using it for a lot of aerobic activities), it seemed like going with something from a more technical company such as Mammut was a good bet. I also liked the dual colorway.

## What I love about it

- Fit\:I have a shorter torso, and the small fits me really well. It doesn’t feel too long in the butt area, as a lot of puffy jackets do, and the arms fit just right. I can put a thin jacket or hoodie under it comfortably without it feeling too tight, but most of the time skiing or doing any other outdoor activities, I will just wear a thermal weight baselayer under it and it feels like a good, comfy fit.
- Range of Motion\:As I mentioned above, a lot of jackets that pack a lot of warmth like this one are so puffy that I feel like a marshmallow and like I can barely move my arms. This jacket I feel I have a full range of motion, and stay warm without being overly too puffy. It is really comfy for activities that have a lot of movement, such as running or climbing.
- Design\:The jacket has one pocket that serves as a stuff sack if I want to pack it up and throw it in a backpack or climbing bag as a backup layer. The pockets are high enough to still be able to use them, even if I have a climbing harness on, and the hood has an elastic on it to ensure a perfect fit to my head. It’s so annoying when a hood is too large and flopping around, inhibiting my visibility when I am recreating, so I love the hood feature. The zipper is also a bright orange color, which makes it really easy to see and use when I have gloves on.
- Style\:Though it isn’t necessarily designed with style in mind, I really like the look of this jacket. The two-tone color is a bit more unique than just the classic one-tone puffy jacket, and I like the technical look of it.
- Quality of Materials: The materials on the Broad Peak IN Hooded Jacket are really high quality. It’s filled with a 800-fill goose down, and the outer material is a Pertex material that is resistant to rips, holes, and punctures, but still super lightweight. Overall this combo of the goose down and Pertex keeps the weight low while maintaining a lot of warmth.
- Durability\:Though I have only had this jacket for about two months, I have worn it almost everyday and I haven't had any durability issues. I have had to wash it a few times because it is a lighter color and gets dirty often, and also seems like it holds in sweat and smells more so than other jackets I have had. Even with all the wearing and a few washes, it still looks brand new, so I expect it will live a long life.
- Warmth\:This jacket is super warm. I have worn it on some really cold days (5–7 degrees) and stayed toasty.
- Weight\:For how warm this jacket is, it's also super light. It weighs .72 lbs, whereas the older jacket that I was looking to replace with this one (The Patagonia Hi Loft Down Jacket) was closer to 1.5 lbs. The low weight of the Broad Peak makes it awesome and easy to toss into a bag as an extra layer, and also makes it a great option to use as a warm midlayer for skiing that's warm, but doesnt feel too heavy or puffy under a shell.

## Issues I’ve encountered

- Pockets\:I do like that the pockets on the Broad Peak IN Hooded jacket are a bit higher to accommodate access if one is wearing a climbing harness, but I do not like that there is no internal pocket. It wish there was an internal pocket to keep my ID/phone/credit card in, because I tend to like to keep those things on me and a bit more stowed in a safe place when recreating outdoors so that I don’t accidentally drop them if I am putting my hands or other gear in and out of my pockets.
- Waterproofing\:This jacket is not waterproof.
- Breathability: I did think this jacket would be slightly more breathable. It really keeps heat in, and I find once I start sweating, it’s game over; it’s hard to dump heat and it isn’t super odor resistant as some similar, activewear-type jackets are, so I have had to wash it a few times already. In the past I have used a lighter jacket like the Arcteryx Atom for a midlayer during skiing or main layer during aerobic activities in the winter, and though it’s not as warm as the Broad Peak, when I sweat in that jacket it does not seem to smell, and it has less insulation in the underarm area, so prevents some of that overheating. It’s a tradeoff if one wants something breathable or warm, but if breathability is their main concern, I wouldn’t recommend the Broad Peak as my top pick.

## Favorite moment with this gear

![](</uploads/mammut rev/mammut2.avif>)

My favorite moment with this jacket so far was a really cold day of ski touring with my pup and partner. We went at sunset and there was a slight storm all day. Right as we got above the cloudline, the sun was setting, and it was so pretty with all the clouds and the recent snow coating the trees. The skiing down was awesome too because it was a very unpopulated area, so there was about a foot of untouched powder. It was a super cold day, especially on the ridge, and especially at sunset, but I was plenty warm by using the Broad Peak on the way up, and tossing a shell over it on the way down.

## Value for the money vs. other options

This jacket seems a bit on the pricey end, but is a pretty good, reasonable deal for a jacket that is so light and warm. The Patagonia Down Hoody jacket would be a comparable option. That jacket retails for the same price, but is about a half pound heavier and the face fabric is not quite as durable. Personally, I think the durability, warmth, and low weight of the Broad Peak makes it worth the money. It is super versatile. I have found a lot of different instances in which this will be my go-to jacket (midlayer for skiing, jacket for climbing, walking the dog on colder days, etc.), and I think it is well made and comfortable.

## Final verdict

The Mammut Broad Peak IN Hooded Jacket is a lightweight, super warm puffy jacket. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an insulating, versatile winter jacket.
