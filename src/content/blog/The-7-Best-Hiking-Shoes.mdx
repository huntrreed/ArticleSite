---

There's nothing like hitting the trails for a day of hiking with the right shoes on your feet. Whether you're trekking up steep inclines or navigating rocky terrain, a good pair of hiking shoes can make all the difference in keeping you comfortable and supported throughout your journey. With so many options available, knowing where to start when selecting the perfect pair of hiking shoes can be overwhelming. So, we've researched for you and compiled a list of the top recommended hiking shoes to help you hit the trails with confidence and comfort!

## A Few Things to Know About Hiking Shoes

### Materials in a Hiking Shoe

Hiking shoes are made of various materials, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some common materials used in hiking shoes:

1. Leather\:Full-grain leather is the most durable material used in hiking shoes. Leather hiking shoes typically last the longest out of any material. In addition, it is highly resistant to abrasions and provides excellent ankle support. But the downfall is that leather shoes tend to be heavier, have a longer break-in period, and are typically more expensive!
2. Synthetic materials\:Many hiking shoes are made of synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, and mesh. These shoes tend to be lighter, more breathable, and faster to dry than leather shoes. However, synthetic shoes are less durable than leather shoes and may not provide as much ankle support.
3. GORE-TEX\:GORE-TEX is a popular waterproof and breathable material used in hiking shoes. If you see a hiking shoe with GTX in the name, the shoe has GORE-TEX! Shoes with GORE-TEX keep your feet dry in wet conditions, but they tend to be more expensive than non-waterproof shoes and can be less breathable.

Overall, the material you choose for your hiking shoes will depend on your personal preferences, the type of hiking you plan to do, and the climate you plan to hike.

### Traction

Hiking shoes come with different types of soles to provide traction on various surfaces. Here are some of the most commonly seen types:

- Vibram\:Vibram is a popular brand of rubber sole that offers excellent traction on rocky terrain. Shoes with Vibram soles are durable and long-lasting.
- Contagrip\:Contagrip is another brand of rubber sole designed for hiking and trail running. It offers good traction on a variety of surfaces, including wet and slippery ones.
- Lug Soles\:Lug soles have deep, wide treads that provide excellent traction on muddy and uneven terrain. However, shoes with lugs may be less comfortable walking on flat surfaces.

### Waterproof and Water-Resistant

If you're planning to hike in wet conditions, choosing shoes that will keep your feet dry is important. The two options are getting something waterproof or water resistant.

- Waterproof\:Waterproof shoes are made with materials, like GORE-TEX or treated leather, that prevent water from seeping in. Waterproof hiking shoes are great for hiking in wet conditions but will also be less breathable.
- Water-Resistant\:Water-resistant shoes are treated with a coating that repels water to some extent; however, the shoes are not fully waterproof. These shoes are good for hiking in light rain or dewy conditions, but moisture will soak through in heavier rain or snow.

## How Should My Hiking Shoes Fit?

Proper fit is essential when it comes to hiking shoes. A well-fitted hiking shoe should feel snug but not tight, with plenty of room to wiggle your toes. In addition, the heel of the shoe should feel snug and not lift when walking.

When trying on hiking shoes, wear the same socks you plan on wearing while hiking to ensure an accurate fit. Walk around in the shoes for at least 10-15 minutes to see if you experience any pressure points or discomfort.

Here are a few specific points to look for when checking if your hiking shoe fits properly:

- Length\:There should be a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.
- Width\:The shoe should feel snug but not tight. Your foot should not slide around inside the shoe. Many hiking shoes come in wide-fit options for hikers with wider feet!
- Arch\:The shoe's arch should match your foot's arch. If you are struggling to find something that has comfortable arch support, it’s a good idea to look into aftermarket insoles!
- Heel\:The heel should feel snug and not lift when walking.
- Flexibility\:The shoe should be flexible enough to bend at the ball of the foot but not in the arch or heel.

It's important to take the time to properly fit your hiking shoes to ensure maximum comfort and reduce the risk of blisters or other foot injuries. If you're unsure about your shoe size or have any questions,reach out to a Camping and Hiking Expert here on Curated!

Now that that’s settled let's get into the best hiking shoes!
