title: The 9 Best Backpacks for Day Hikes
---

tl;drWhen it comes to hiking, having the right gear is essential for a successful and enjoyable day on the trail! While most hikers invest a significant amount of time in selecting the perfect hiking boots, clothing, and other essentials, one item that often gets overlooked is the backpack—or when referring to a backpack that’s primarily suited for day hikes, a daypack. However, choosing the right daypack is just as crucial, as it will carry all your essentials and provide comfort throughout your hike!

In this article, we will talk about the top most recommended daypacks for hiking, factoring in capacity, comfort, features, and durability. Whether you're about to hit the hiking trails for the first time, or if you’re a seasoned hiker, having a reliable daypack that suits your needs will make your experience all that much better. With the right pack on your back, you can confidently hit the trails, knowing that you have reliable and functional gear that can withstand the rigor of the outdoors!

## Some Key Considerations

Before we get into our list, let’s talk about a few key things to think about when looking at hiking backpacks. If you have questions on any of these points, reach out to a[Camping and Hiking Expert](https://www.curated.com/shop/camping?ref=journal)here on Curated and we would be happy to dive into them more.

- Capacity\:Determine how much gear and supplies you'll need to carry for a typical day hike. Daypacks usually range from 20–35 liters in capacity. If you don’t tend to bring a lot of gear on hikes, the lower end of this range would work, but if you tend to bring a lot of extra layers and snacks, you might want to go larger. Before deciding on a capacity, make a note of the essentials that you bring on a hike. These will include things like water, snacks, extra layers, a first aid kit, and any other personal items you might want to bring such as a camera.
- Comfort and Fit\:Look for a backpack with adjustable straps and a supportive suspension system. The pack should distribute weight evenly across your shoulders, back, and hips. Opt for padded shoulder straps and a waist belt to reduce strain and enhance comfort during long hikes.
- Accessibility\:Consider the accessibility of the backpack's compartments and pockets. Look for multiple entry points, such as top-loading, front-loading, or side zippers, to easily access your gear without having to unpack everything.
- Organizational Features\:Similarly, pay attention to the pack's organizational features, such as pockets, loops, and attachment points. These can help you keep your gear organized and easily accessible throughout the hike. I also like packs with some external pockets that are easy to access while hiking, and compression straps on the side if I want to attach a wet rain jacket to the outside of my pack so it doesn’t get the rest of my gear wet.
- Hydration Compatibility\:Ensure the backpack has a dedicated hydration bladder, water bladder sleeve, or a compatible water bottle holder. Staying hydrated on the trail is crucial!

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get into our list of the top daypacks for hiking.
