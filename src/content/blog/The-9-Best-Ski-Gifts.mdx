## 1. A Book about Skiing

[Freedom Found: Warren Miller’s Autobiography](https://warrenmiller.com/freedomfound?ref=journal)

A book is a particularly great option if you’re looking for a Father’s Day gift, Mother’s Day gift, or birthday gift in the summer. A book about skiing will keep the boredom at bay until the next ski season arrives and give the skier in your life something to get excited about during the summer months.

One of my favorite options is[Freedom Found: Warren Miller’s Autobiography](https://warrenmiller.com/freedomfound?ref=journal),\_written by ski legend Warren Miller. It’s an autobiography about a classic name in the ski world who lived an incredible and inspiring life. If you are looking for a book for a backcountry skier,\_[Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain](https://www.mountaineers.org/books/books/staying-alive-in-avalanche-terrain-3rd-edition?ref=journal)by Bruce Temper is a must-have for anyone venturing into the backcountry. It gives useful tips on reading avalanche danger, knots that will come in handy during any rescue operations, and tons of other information that will come in handy in the real world! Another classic is[Fifty Places to Ski and Snowboard Before You Die: Downhill Experts Share the World's Greatest Destinations](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fifty-places-to-ski-and-snowboard-before-you-die-chris-santella/1114253988?ref=journal)by Chris Santella and Matt Hansen. This book is particularly great for skiers who like to travel. It will inspire them to start planning their winter ski trips!

## 2.[Baselayers](https://www.curated.com/c/winter-sports-baselayer-tops?source=pdp-breadcrumbs&ref=journal)

The[Smartwool Merino 250 Crew Top](https://www.curated.com/products/4497212/smartwool-women-s-merino-250-crew-baselayer-top?ref=journal)

Keep them warm and cozy on the mountain with top-notch baselayers. My favorites are the Smartwool Merino 250 Pants and the[Smartwool Merino 250 Crew Top](https://www.curated.com/products/4497212/smartwool-women-s-classic-thermal-merino-baselayer-crew?ref=journal). They are super comfortable, moisture-wicking, and offer great temperature regulation. Base layers are something every skier needs, so they make the perfect gift that any skier will be sure to get a lot of use out of!

## 3.[Ski Patterned Button-Up Shirt](https://shop.tetongravity.com/products/apres-vous-shirt?ref=journal)

The Après Vous Flannel from Teton Gravity Researh

Give them style both on and off the slopes with a fun ski-patterned button-up shirt. This trendy shirt from Teton Gravity Research lets them show off their love for skiing during après-ski gatherings or casual outings. It’s made of soft twill fabric and has a pocket on the front to hold the essentials. Wearing this around is a great way to strike up a conversation with other ski enthusiasts at the local brewery, and it’s versatile enough that your gift recipient will get year-round use out of it!

## 4.[Tuning Kit](https://www.dakine.com/products/deluxe-tune-tuning-kit?ref=journal)

The Dakine Deluxe Tuning Kit

Help the skier in your life keep their skis in tip-top shape by gifting them a tuning kit. The Dakine Deluxe Tuning kit comes with a few different types of wax, edge sharpeners, a scraper, and a carrier that makes it easy to pack up and keep it organized when it’s not in use.
I’ve used this kit myself for years and given several as gifts! It is consistently one of the best purchases I’ve made. Skiers tend to love this gift because it helps save them money by avoiding the need to take their skis to a shop to get them tuned up a few times a year. Plus, it gives them a fun ski-related project to do themselves. It's a practical and thoughtful gift for skiers who take pride in caring for their gear.

## 5.[Gloves](https://www.curated.com/c/winter-sports-gloves-mittens?source=pdp-breadcrumbs&ref=journal)

The[Hestra Army Leather Heli Ski 5 Finger](https://www.curated.com/products/2957830/hestra-army-leather-heli-ski-5-finger?ref=journal)

A good pair of gloves is another must-have for any skier! Keep their hands warm and protected with top-quality gloves. My favorite is the[Hestra Army Leather Heli Ski 5 Finger](https://www.curated.com/products/2957830/hestra-army-leather-heli-ski-gloves?ref=journal). They are super durable, well insulated, and still give you plenty of dexterity while wearing them. If you’re looking for something fancier, check out the[Hestra Power Heated Gauntlet Gloves](https://www.curated.com/products/4811081/hestra-men-s-power-heater-gauntlet-gloves?ref=journal). These gloves are heated and have the same high-quality construction as the Army Leather Heli gloves. These are a particularly great gift idea for anyone who skis in super chilly areas or tends to run cold!

If you’re giving your skier non-heated gloves, throw in a few[hand warmers](https://www.amazon.com/HotHands-Hand-Toe-Warmers-Activated/dp/B06ZYW6HDK/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=hand+warmers+for+skiing&qid=1690232724&sr=8-6&ref=journal)or some glove liners! These are a great addition to gloves, and they’ll be sure to appreciate it on those freezing powder days when they can keep getting laps in instead of going to the ski lodge to warm up.

## 6.[Ski Socks](https://www.curated.com/c/winter-sports-socks?ref=journal)

The[Smartwool Full Cushion OTC Socks](https://www.curated.com/products/6702050/smartwool-ski-full-cushion-otc-socks?ref=journal)

If your skier is already all set on hand protection with a good pair of gloves, consider giving them some ski socks. A pair of ski socks might sound basic, but trust me — skiers will appreciate high-performance ski socks. Quality socks will keep their feet dry, comfortable, and blister-free during long days on the slopes. My favorites are the[Smartwool Full Cushion OTC Socks](https://www.curated.com/products/6702050/smartwool-ski-full-cushion-otc-socks?ref=journal), but no matter which ones you go with, make sure the socks you choose are moisture-wicking and have some amount of ski-specific cushioning.

## 7. A Buff or[Ski Hood](https://www.curated.com/products/6386645/blackstrap-solid-hood-balaclava?ref=journal)

A Ski Buff

Enhance their cold-weather gear with a versatile buff or ski hood. These accessories offer extra warmth for the neck and face, making them practical gifts for chilly ski days. Plus, they come in various stylish designs, adding a touch of personality to their ski ensemble. I personally have three buffs, and since I wear them every time I ski and even on a lot of trail runs during the summer, I get tons of use out of all of them!

Ski hoods are worn under ski helmets and provide warmth to your head, face, and that little area between your[helmet](https://www.curated.com/c/ski-snowboard-helmets?ref=journal)and ski[goggles](https://www.curated.com/c/ski-snowboard-goggles?ref=journal)that sometimes gets cold! They are often internally lined with fleece for optimal warmth and comfort. These are great skiing gifts for those who are hard to shop for and those who tend to run cold!

## 8.[Boot Dryer](https://www.curated.com/products/8812108/shoe-gear-shoe-ski-boots-dryer?ref=journal)

Shoe Gear High Country Shoe & Boot Dryer

Help the skier in your life start each ski day with dry, toasty feet by gifting them a boot dryer. Wet boots are no fun, but this handy device efficiently dries out their ski boots overnight, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable skiing experience throughout their trip. This is something that every skier will use, but it is often something they don’t know they need until they have it!

## 9. Ski Lessons
