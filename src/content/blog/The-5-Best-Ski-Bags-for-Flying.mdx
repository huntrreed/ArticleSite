title: The 5 Best Ski Bags for Flying
---

Skiing is a great reason to travel and get outside into new places. And if you’re looking to ski somewhere new that’s far from home, chances are that you’re going to have to hop on a plane! But before you book those tickets and pack up your gear, you’re going to need to have a reliable ski bag for transporting your skis without worrying about them being damaged.

Having a sturdy ski bag is crucial to ensure the safety and protection of your valuable ski equipment throughout your trip. In this article, we'll dive into the top ski bags specifically designed for flying, in hopes that this list will help you make an informed decision and choose the perfect bag for your exact needs.

Though I have luckily never had any problems with my skis getting damaged in transit (I made sure I had a good ski bag!), I have had my fair share of arriving at a destination just to find that something in my suitcase has broken from getting tossed around during the loading and unloading process. Getting to your ski destination just to find that a piece of your binding or a boot buckle is broken will certainly put a damper on your ski trip. Lucky for you, that is avoidable by ensuring that you have a good bag and pack it in a smart way to minimize the chances for something to go wrong.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Ski Bag

Before we get into our list of top ski bags, let’s quickly go over a few factors to keep in mind when shopping for a bag!

### Bag size and capacity

First things first, you'll want to ensure that your ski bag is spacious enough to accommodate your skis, poles, and other essential gear such as mittens, helmet, goggles, and boots. Bag size is typically measured in length, and there are many length options, so make sure to check that it can accommodate the length of your skis, or the length of your longest pair of skis if traveling with more than one pair. If you are traveling with more than one pair, also take that into account. If traveling with two pairs of skis - make sure that you get a ski bag that can fit two pairs of skis. Even if you plan to travel alone most of the time, it’s still a great idea to get a bag that can accommodate two pairs in the off chance that you end up traveling with a friend eventually. You will spare them the need to buy a ski bag of their own, and it will be easier to get through the airport and to your hotel with just a single ski bag.

### Durability and protection features

Flying can be rough on any luggage, and ski gear is no exception! With the price of ski gear and how fragile and important things such as bindings and helmets can be, you do not want to take any risks when traveling with your ski equipment. Make sure your ski bag is durable and can protect your gear. The most durable bag options have high-density polyester or nylon as the exterior fabric. Reinforced padding and sturdy construction are also essential for providing ample protection against impacts, bumps, and potential mishandling.

### Weight and portability

No one wants to start their ski trip feeling weighed down by a heavy bag. Opt for a lightweight ski bag that won't eat into your baggage weight limit, cause any extra baggage fees, and will be easy to carry around the airport. Consider bags that feature ergonomic handles, padded shoulder straps, or even wheels for effortless transportation.

### Additional storage compartments and organization options

Having additional storage compartments and organization options in your ski bag can be a game-changer. Look for bags that offer separate compartments for boots, helmets, goggles, and other accessories. This way, you can keep your gear neatly organized and easily accessible throughout your trip!

Now that we have the basics covered, let’s dive into our list of the top ski bags for flying. These bags are designed with the factors I’ve mentioned in mind, making them ideal for hassle-free air travel with your ski gear.

## Top Ski Bags for Flying

### 1.[Dakine Fall Line Ski Roller Bag](https://www.curated.com/products/7414016/dakine-fall-line-ski-roller-bag?ref=journal)

One of the most popular choices, The Dakine Fall Line Roller Bag is a more bare bones ski bag designed to make your life easier with its simplicity. It can carry up to two pairs of skis, making it a great option for couples traveling to ski together, moms or dads looking to pack both their own skis and their kids skis in one bag, or single skiers who have decision anxiety about which pair of skis to bring (now you don’t have to choose!) The Fall Line Ski Roller Bag features padded dividers to keep your skis and poles separated and protected during transit, and a separate compartment for boot storage, so that your boots stay well protected and don’t bang around during takeoff or landing.

Though it does have padding, as mentioned, it doesn’t have quite as much padding as other options, so if maximum safety is your priority, you might want to spend some extra cash on a bag with more protection and padding! Bonus: it also comes in tons of color options, which can be helpful for making your bag stand out when picking it up from baggage claim!
