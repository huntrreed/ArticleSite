### 1.[Enforcer 100](https://www.curated.com/products/6384259/nordica-enforcer-100-skis-2023-165-cm?ref=journal)

###

The hands-down most popular ski from Nordica is the Enforcer 100. It offers unmatched performance in various snow conditions and terrain. Its waist width of 100 millimeters (mm) perfectly balances stability and maneuverability. With Nordica's Energy 2 titanium construction, it combines lightweight responsiveness with the strength of titanium, ensuring precise control and edge grip on any terrain. Whether you're carving groomers or shredding through powder, the Enforcer 100 will propel advanced skiers to new heights of performance. It is a bit on the stiffer end, so it will feel a bit hard to drive and maneuver for newer skiers.

### 2.[Santa Ana 93](https://www.curated.com/products/6386266/nordica-santa-ana-93-skis-women-s-2023-165-cm?ref=journal)

The 104mm waist width and rockered profile provide excellent floatation and maneuverability in deep snow. Compared to the classic Enforcer models, the Enforcer Free is more maneuverable and easier to drive thanks to its increased rocker in the tip and tail. It still features the same Nordica's Energy 2 titanium present in the classic Enforcer line, making it stable and light. The Enforcer 104 Free is geared more towards advanced to expert skiers seeking big powder lines.

### 7.[Santa Ana 104 Free](https://www.curated.com/products/6385267/nordica-santa-ana-104-free-skis-women-s-2023-172-cm?ref=journal)
