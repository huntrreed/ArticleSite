About this Review\:This review is my own honest opinion of the jacket, which I bought with my own money in October 2020.

## My take

The[Rab Women’s Kinetic 2.0 Waterproof Jacket](https://www.curated.com/products/4110135/rab-women-s-kinetic-2-0-shell-jacket?ref=journal)is a great waterproof yet breathable jacket that doesn’t feel as “plasticky” as some rain jackets do and has a really sturdy face fabric that can handle some scrapes and abrasion.

## What I was looking for

I was looking for a rain jacket that I could use during outdoor activities that would breathe well but keep me dry inside. I wanted something that wasn’t going to feel crinkly when I moved around as some rain jackets do, and something that wasn’t going to rip off or get damaged if I was using it for climbing.

## Why I chose this gear

I chose this because a friend had been raving about Rab gear, and I had never used anything from them. My normal go-to for rain jackets was Patagonia, but at the time of purchasing the Kinetic, my Patagonia Torrentshell rain jacket was on its last leg. It also felt terrible and hot to wear when I was doing anything athletic so I wanted to make sure my next jacket was breathable, and the Kinetic seemed like it would be.

Ice climbing in the Rab Kinetic!

## What I love about it

- Range of motion\:The material in the Rab Kinetic is really stretchy so I feel like I have a great range of motion. It doesn’t feel inhibiting at all to move in, regardless of the type of activity I am doing.
- Design\:The design is really simple yet functional. The pockets are high enough on the sides that if I’m wearing a climbing harness, I can still access them, and they are very roomy so I can fit whatever I might need. The hood also has an internal part that goes over the top of the face and an outer part that sticks out a bit more so that rain doesn’t get in the jacket through the hood, which I thought was a thoughtful feature.
- Quality and durability\:The face fabric is both waterproof and abrasion resistant. It really does check all the boxes. It’s breathable, keeps me dry, and I can be kind of hard on it and know it won’t rip or compromise the waterproofing.
- Pockets\:The pockets are roomy, and as I mentioned, are a bit higher than average jacket pockets to accommodate access when wearing a climbing harness.
- Breathability\:Its material is incredibly breathable for a rain jacket.
- Waterproofing\:I have worn the Rab Kinetic in some serious rain storms and never felt like it soaked through at all.
- Features\:This jacket comes with a stuff sack for easy packing for tossing into a daypack or climbing bag just in case the weather changes!

## Issues I’ve encountered

- Breathability\:I wish this jacket had armpit vents. As far as activewear rain jackets go, it’s almost unusual for them not to have pit-zip vents, and although the face material does a pretty good job being breathable in the first place, this would have been a nice feature to have.
- Warmth\:It is not insulated, so although it keeps me dry and protects me from wind, there are better options for those seeking warmth.

## Favorite moment with this gear

![](/uploads/rab/rab3.avif)

My favorite trip with this jacket was a climbing outing with[Camp USA](https://www.camp.it/d/us/us/corporate?ref=journal), a climbing company. About six of us went to Colorado in May, where we did some ice climbing and traditional climbing and learned a bit about their climbing gear. I had so much fun and learned a ton about ice climbing as it was my first time, and the Rab Kinetic was absolutely the perfect jacket for that. It kept me warm and dry without getting too sweaty.

## Value for the money vs. other options

For upwards of $200, it is not the cheapest option on the market but any other cheaper, comparable options are not as breathable. For example, the[Marmot PreCip](https://www.curated.com/products/5887020/marmot-women-s-precip-eco-jacket?ref=journal)is another waterproof option and only about $70, but it is made of a much different material, so it will not breathe at all, feel crinkly, and in general not last very long.

I know the Rab Kinetic $200+ investment is worth it because I will have this jacket forever. It is really functional for the situations I am usually in—some kind of outdoor, physical activity where I need a rain jacket.

## Final verdict

The[Rab Women’s Kinetic 2.0 Waterproof Jacket](https://www.curated.com/products/4110135/rab-women-s-kinetic-2-0-shell-jacket?ref=journal)is a really underrated jacket that’s designed to keep the wearer dry for years to come. It is really breathable and comfortable, especially in the category of rain jackets, and well worth the price tag.
