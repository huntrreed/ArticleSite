title: 10 Gluten-Free Camping Meals
---

Going camping is an exciting adventure that allows us to escape from our daily routines and enjoy the great outdoors. However, for those who have food allergies such as celiac disease or gluten intolerance, planning camping meals can be a daunting task. A lot of simple recipes such as spaghetti or hot dogs can be easily made gluten-free by substituting a few ingredients such as regular pasta for gluten-free pasta or regular hot dog buns for gluten-free buns. But let’s be honest, most of the time the gluten-free substitutes aren’t quite as good as the normal version, and there are tons of other meal options that don’t require any big substitutes to be gluten-free, and that's what we'll list below!

Growing up with a mom who had celiac disease and having gone through a four-year stint of being gluten-free for myself, I understand the struggle of trying to come up with camping meals that are both good and cater to those who are gluten-free! But with a little planning, you can chef up some delicious and nutritious gluten-free camping food in the backcountry! So, get ready to pack your camping gear and try out these delicious gluten-free camping meal ideas on your next adventure!

## 1. Rice Bowls

Rice bowls are super versatile. There are endless options of what you can add to your rice bowl, and each person in your group can customize their own. Rice is very filling after a day of hiking or exploring around outside, it’s easy to make and best of all–it’s gluten-free! Start by cooking rice according to the package instructions, then add your favorite toppings like grilled chicken or tofu, veggies, avocado, peanuts, green onions, or whatever other options you can think of! Drizzle with gluten-free soy sauce or dressing for extra flavor.

## 2. Grilled Chicken and Vegetables

Grilled chicken and vegetables is a nutritious and easy-to-make camp dinner. Marinate chicken breasts with your favorite gluten-free sauce, then grill them along with sliced vegetables like peppers, onions, and zucchini. I like to serve this meal with some rice or quinoa on the side!

## 3. Stuffed Sweet Potatoes

Stuffed sweet potatoes are a delicious gluten-free camping meal that may seem super fancy but is actually very simple. Start by roasting the sweet potatoes over the campfire, then stuff them with cooked ground beef, beans, and veggies. Wrap them in foil and put them back in the campfire for a few more minutes, and remove! Top with cheese (dairy-free cheese if there are vegans or dairy-intolerant folks in your group) or a gluten-free sauce and enjoy! If you’re not a fan of sweet potatoes, this can also be easily done with bell peppers!

## 4. Chicken Fajitas

Chicken fajitas are a fun and flavorful gluten-free option that's perfect for a group. Cook sliced chicken, peppers, and onions in a cast-iron skillet over a camp stove or campfire, then serve with warm corn tortillas, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. This is a great meal for the last day or so of camping where you may have leftover vegetables from past meals. Fry them up in the skillet, and add them to your fajitas instead of packing them out in your trash!

## 5. Corn Tortilla Tacos

Sticking to the Mexican cuisine theme, corn tortilla tacos are another great option, perfect for a quick lunch or dinner. Cook up some ground beef or tofu with gluten-free taco seasoning, fry up some peppers, onions, corn (cut off the cob), zucchini, or whatever other vegetables you might have in a pan, then serve with warm corn tortillas, lettuce, tomato, and salsa. Add your favorite toppings like cheese or avocado!

## 6. Lentil Soup

Soup is a great camp food for those sleeping under the stars in colder weather, and lentil soup is both nutritious and gluten-free! Cook lentils, carrots, celery, and onions in a pot over a camping stove or campfire, then season with your favorite gluten-free herbs and spices. Serve with gluten-free bread or crackers for a warm and hearty dinner.

## 7. Grilled Fish

Grilled fish is a healthy and delicious meal for campers who either have a portable grill, a grill attachment to their camping stove, or a grate over their campfire! Marinate your favorite fish with a gluten-free seasoning, this can be fancy or just a simple garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil, then grill the fish until it's cooked through. Serve with a side of grilled veggies or rice for a balanced and nutritious meal. Bonus points if you caught the fish on your camping trip!

Quinoa salad is refreshing and perfect for a quick lunch or snack. Cook quinoa according to the package instructions, then mix it with chopped veggies, herbs, and a gluten-free dressing. Sometimes I’ll even add some apples or pomegranate seeds to get a little fruit in! Top with grilled chicken or tofu for extra protein and enjoy a flavorful and healthy meal. This is a great option if you’re looking for some food options to make ahead of time and bring along on your camping trip! Store this in a Tupperware and pack it in the cooler to avoid the need to cook and clean quite as often when you’re out in the backcountry!

## 9. Chili

Another hearty option for cooler evenings is chili. Cook ground beef or turkey with beans, tomatoes, and gluten-free spices in a pot over a camping stove or campfire. Serve with gluten-free bread, crackers, or tortilla chips, and top with cheese or sour cream for a delicious and warming dinner.

## 10. Omelet

Typically more of a breakfast option, these are great to make in the morning before you hit the trails, or for dinner! Omelets are versatile and easy to customize for each camper. Whisk eggs in a bowl and add your favorite gluten-free fillings like cheese, veggies, or bacon. Cook in a skillet over a camping stove or campfire until the eggs are set, then fold and serve for a quick and tasty breakfast or dinner.
