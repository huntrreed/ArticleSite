title: '6-Person Tents: How to Choose the Right One for You'
---

TLDR\:Shopping for the right six-person tent requires you to be clear about the type of weather you’re camping in, the type of camping you typically do, and any other specific needs you require out of your camping shelter. Narrowing these things down can help you figure out how to choose the best six-person tent for your needs.

Having been an avid camper my whole life, I understand the importance of having the right tent. It can make all the difference between a fun, carefree camping trip, and a stressful, issue-ridden trip. In this guide I’ll break down everything you need to know to ensure you skip the headaches that come with having the right tent and get a tent that keeps you warm and comfortable for many trips to come.

## What Is a 6-Person Tent?

First, let’s talk about what a six-person tent is. As the name indicates, a six-person tent is a tent that’s meant to accommodate up to six campers. This is an ideal size if you typically camp with large groups of friends or your family. Even if you have only three or four campers sleeping in your tent but like to have extra space for gear, six-person tents could be a wonderful option for you!

## What to Consider When Buying a 6-Person Tent

Before browsing around for your next tent, there are a few questions to ask yourself to narrow down the search for the tent that will work best for you!

### What Weather Will You Primarily Be Camping In?

Not all six-person tents are made equal. Some tents have better waterproofing capabilities for campers who tend to find themselves camping in[rainy conditions](https://www.curated.com/journal/3256000/the-best-tents-for-camping-in-the-rain?ref=journal)fairly often. Other tents are more stable in the wind. If you camp in the summer when the temperatures are a bit warmer, you’ll want a tent that has extra ventilation to keep you and your tentmates cool at night. If you’re camping year-round, you’ll need a special four-season[tent that can handle snow](https://www.curated.com/journal/3218000/the-best-winter-tents-for-camping-in-the-cold?ref=journal).

### How Much Space Do You Need?

Though six-person tents are meant for sleeping six campers, some have larger interiors than others. If you want to make your tent more of a home base that your campmates can hang out in and play games during rainstorms, you’ll want a tent with extra space inside — and possibly a room divider so you can have one area for sleeping and one for hanging out. If you don’t plan on spending too much time inside aside from sleeping, a smaller and more compact tent will be a better option for your style of camping.

### How Much Should a 6-Person Tent Cost?

Prices for tents vary quite a bit depending on the materials, features, and brand. Here are the main tiers and what you can expect from each:

- Low end ([$100](https://www.curated.com/journal/276000/is-the-100-dollar-tent-worth-it?ref=journal)to $200)\:Basic features and less durable materials. Typically heavier and more complicated to set up since they lack a lot of the “easy setup features” (more on that later!) that mid or high end tents have.
- Mid range (between $200 and $400)\:A good compromise between durability and weather resistance. These will have more extra features such as room dividers and better ventilation.
- High end (above $400)\:Made from top-of-the-line materials and offer the best weather protection. They include more features that improve comfort and convenience. A lot of the high-end tents are more specific to one style of camping (eg, winter camping), but they might be overkill for casual camping trips from spring through fall.

The balance between price and amenities will be determined by your budget, but investing in a higher-end tent can give you a more comfortable camping experience and prevent you from needing to replace your tent after a few seasons.

## What Are the Different Types of 6-Person Tents?

Now that we’ve covered the basic things you need to consider before purchasing, it’s time to talk about the different types of six-person tents you’ll see out there. There are two basic types of six-person tents you'll run into.

### Dome Tents

The dome tent is the classic style of tent that has a low, curved ceiling. They are typically too short to stand up in, but their curved shape helps them to be more stable in high winds.

Benefits:

- Round shape deflects wind and makes them more stable during gusty conditions
- Easy to set up because they have fewer poles and a more straightforward setup process

Be Aware:

- Not as much interior space — typically can’t stand up in them and the floor space is more limited because of their smaller size compared to cabin tents
- Smaller interior can be a bit stuffy compared to cabin tents, which have higher ceilings and larger windows.

### Cabin Tents

Cabin tents have vertical or almost vertical walls and are shaped like small houses rather than domes. Their extra interior space and more homey style design are better for campers who plan on hanging out inside the tent and want their tent to feel more like an Airbnb rather than just a spot to sleep for the night.

Benefits:

- Vertical walls offer more interior space and headroom, typically enough for adults to stand inside
- Larger walls are almost always entirely mesh, which vents the warm air out and allows more cool air inside the tent
- Many models include room dividers that offer more privacy and organization than a dome-style tent

Be Aware:

- More complicated setup compared to dome tents — typically requires more than one adult to set up
- Bulkier and heavier, which makes transportation and storage more difficult
- Tall, flat walls are less aerodynamic, making them more susceptible to being flapped around in the wind

## Features to Look for in a 6-Person Tent

Here are a few specific features to look out for when shopping for your six-person tent. Not all of these may be useful or relevant to your camping situation, but it’s helpful to understand your options.

- Easy setup features\:Some six-person tents are[easier to set up](https://www.curated.com/journal/428000/how-to-set-up-a-tent?ref=journal)than others. While some six-person tents might just require a single person for setup, others are more intricate and require more than one person. If ease of setup is important to you, look for tents labeled “quick pitch setup” or tents that have pre-bent poles, pre-attached pole hubs, color-coded poles, or easy clip attachments. These will save you time and energy when setting up your campsite!
- [Weather-resistance](https://www.curated.com/journal/1095001/how-to-stay-dry-and-comfortable-when-camping-in-the-rain?ref=journal)features\:Though all tents come with a rainfly to protect from light rain, some rainflies are more robust than others. Flies with a silicone-treated coating or a polyurethane coating are going to keep water out the best. Ensure your tent also has taped seams to prevent water from leaking in in the weak points of the tent. Some tents also have bathtub-style floors, which means the extra reinforced and waterproofed floor of the tent comes up a few inches on the walls of the tent. This is in case any water begins pooling under or around your tent, it won't be able to rise above the floor line and seep into your tent. If you camp in a lot of windy areas, make sure you get a more aerodynamic tent such as a dome tent with a lot of guylines, which can attach to several tent stakes and provide a more stable feel in high wind.
- Room dividers\:Many six-person tents have removable room dividers inside the tent.[Having two rooms](https://www.curated.com/journal/3410001/the-best-multi-room-tents-for-your-family-friends?ref=journal)can be helpful for a few reasons. First, it can give campers some privacy to change. It can also be useful for parents camping with children who have an earlier bedtime, as the kids can sleep in one room and not be woken up by parents rustling around when they go to bed a few hours later. Lastly, if you want to separate your tent and have one area for sleeping and one for hanging out, a room divider can help keep the two areas of your tent separated.
- Storage and organization\:Most tents have some form of gear lofts or gear storage pockets inside the tent. This is a terrific way to keep your important items such as keys, headlamp, and phones in an easy-to-access location.
- Extended awning or vestibule\:When a rainfly is on the tent, it typically creates a covered vestibule outside of the tent. This is usually a good place to store gear outside of the tent so it doesn’t take up floor space but still stays protected from rain. Some six-person tents have extended vestibules or awnings that can provide a porch-like area where campers can set up[camp chairs](https://www.curated.com/journal/2851000/camping-chair-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you?ref=journal)or a food station. This not only allows you to hang out outside during a storm without getting wet, but it also offers protection from the harsh sunlight on warm days without needing to take shelter inside the tent itself.

We’ve covered a lot of information, but if you’re still not sure which tent is the best six-person tent for you, check out these examples of Curated customers whom I’ve helped find their ideal tent. Each camper has different needs in a tent, which I’ve given some information about, as well as listing a few tents that would be a good fit for them.

### Leona, the Camp-Savvy Mom

Leona loves to take her kids and their 50lb dog on family camping trips during the summer. She encourages her kids to invite their friends so usually ends up having an extra kid or two with her on her trips. She’s not as concerned with her budget as much as finding something that can withstand wear and tear from the elements and kids romping around inside the tent and using the zippers over and over (kids can be hard on tents!).

Features to Look for:

- Room dividers
- Peak height that’s tall enough that she can stand up inside the tent
- Extra square feet of floor space inside to keep everyone comfortable
- Enough vents to get good airflow in the summer months
- Massive vestibule or screened porch for gear and an outdoor hangout spot

Tents that would be a good fit for Leona:

- [Big Agnes Big House 6](https://www.curated.com/products/8773007/big-agnes-big-house-6-tent?ref=journal)with[Big House Vestibule](https://www.curated.com/products/8824034/big-agnes-vestibule-big-house-6p-tent?ref=journal)

- Nemo Wagontop 6P

### Ethan, The Adventure Seeker

Ethan enjoys remote car camping with his group of friends. They don’t usually spend much time at camp aside from sleeping and meals, so a ton of interior room isn’t as important as having something that can withstand any type of weather conditions they might encounter.

Features to Look for:

- 6-person dome-style tent to better handle wind
- Compact, lightweight, and easy to put together so they can spend less time on camp setup and more time on adventures
- Enough storage space for everyone's gear

Tents that would be a good fit for Ethan:
