1. Day hikes\:Small daypacks are ideal for carrying essentials like water, snacks, sunscreen, and a first aid kit on day hikes.

3. Biking\:Small daypacks can be used for short bike rides, especially if you need to carry a few small items like a tire repair kit, extra tube, water bottle, phone, and snack.
4. Travel\:Small daypacks are the perfect size to be used as a carry-on bag for flights and double as a useful pack for a day of sightseeing where you might need to carry some water, your wallet, a jacket, and a camera.
5. Rock climbing\:For shorter climbing routes or bouldering sessions, a small daypack can be used to carry water, chalk, and other essentials.
6. Snowshoeing or cross-country skiing: A small daypack can be useful for carrying extra layers, food, and water on snowy hikes or ski trips.

Overall, small daypacks are versatile and can be used for a variety of outdoor adventures that require carrying minimal gear and supplies.

Though each pack is a bit different, here are some common features that you might find in a small daypack:

1. Lightweight and compact: A small daypack is designed to be easy to carry and store, so it should be made from lightweight materials and able to fold down to a small size when not in use.
2. Padded shoulder straps\:A good daypack should have padded shoulder straps to distribute the weight of the pack evenly across your shoulders and prevent discomfort.
3. Breathable back panel\:Many small daypacks have a breathable back panel to allow air to circulate and prevent your back from getting sweaty.
4. Multiple compartments\:A small daypack should have enough compartments and pockets to organize your gear and make it easily accessible. Ideally at least a main compartment and another front compartment, but the more organization the better. There’s nothing worse than needing to dig through all your belongings to get to something at the bottom of a backpack with only a single compartment!
5. Hydration compatibility: Many small daypacks come with a hydration bladder or water bladder compartment or a pocket to hold a water bottle.
6. Compression straps\:Compression straps allow you to adjust the size of your pack to fit your gear snugly and prevent it from shifting around during your hike.
7. Durable materials\:A small daypack should be made from durable materials to withstand the rigors of outdoor use.

These are just a few of the common features you might find in a small daypack. Ultimately, the right daypack for you will depend on what you’re specifically looking to use it for as well as your personal preferences.

The backpack features a comfortable and breathable mesh back panel, as well as padded shoulder straps and a removable hip belt. It has multiple pockets for organization, including a front pocket with a mesh organizer and a hydration bladder sleeve. All Osprey packs have large plastic loops on their zippers, which makes it easy to zip and unzip with gloves on, or with one hand if you’re trying to access something without completely taking your pack off. One of the stand-out features of the Osprey Daylite Backpack is that it can be attached to other Osprey backpacks, making it a convenient add-on for longer trips.

It has multiple pockets for organization, including a front pocket with a mesh organizer, two hip belt pockets, and a hydration bladder sleeve. My dad gifted me one of these in 2012 and I still use it on many of my adventures to this day…talk about durable!

### 8. Gregory Citro

The Gregory Citro 24 H2O Hydration Pack is a high-performance daypack that is designed for hiking and other outdoor activities. Where this pack really stands out is its back panel and suspension comfort, especially on longer treks. It features a ventilated back panel and a mesh suspension system and a 3D Hydro Reservoir System which provides a comfortable and stable fit for the hydration bladder. Traditional hydration bladders will sit flat against the back panel of the backpack, which can feel annoying and uncomfortable when filled with water, but the 3D Hydro Reservoir System uses a soft-molded back panel to create a three-dimensional shape that conforms to the contours of your body. This helps to distribute the weight of the water evenly and prevent the bladder from shifting around while you hike. Additionally, the system uses a quick-drying material in the panel that prevents mold and mildew from forming inside the reservoir. This hydration sleeve can accommodate a 3-liter hydration reservoir. Other features on this pack include multiple pockets for organization and easy access to your gear, plus a durable nylon face fabric.

- Capacity: 24 liters
- Weight:1.2 kg (2 lb 9 oz)

One unique feature of this pack is its integrated rain cover that can be quickly deployed to keep your gear dry during unexpected showers.

- Capacity:24 L
- Weight:1.3 kg (2 lb 13 oz)
