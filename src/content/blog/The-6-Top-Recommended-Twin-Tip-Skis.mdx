title: The 6 Top Recommended Twin Tip Skis
---

Since they were first manufactured in the late 1990s, twin tip skis have changed the world of skiing, especially for freestyle and park skiers. This new design opened up new ways of being creative on the hill and pushed the bounds of the sport. From their initial days of mainly being used by freestyle skiers doing crazy jumps and tricks, twin tips have since become a common sight in every type of terrain at every ski resort around the world. Currently, twin tip skis come in designs for every type of skier, no matter what kind of terrain you prefer, or your skill level.

## What’s a Twin Tip Ski?

As you could likely guess from the name, twin tips[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have an uplifted tip and tail design, unlike classic flat tail[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), which only have the tip uplifted. A flared up tail allows for backwards skiing (also known as “riding switch”), as well as skiing forward, which is particularly helpful for skiers looking to do tricks.

Twin tips are most popular with freestyle skiers, but they can also be a great choice for skiers who don’t plan to spend most of the day in the park. Their unique shape and extra tip and tail rocker enables easier turn initiation, enhanced maneuverability, and a more playful feel, compared to classic flat tail[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). This makes twin tips suitable for a variety of terrain, including groomed runs, moguls, powder, as well as the terrain park. The playful feel allows skiers to be more dynamic and creative with every turn, whether you’re hitting the park or skiing all-mountain with a bit of freestyle flair.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Twin Tip Ski

Twin tip skis come in a variety of stiffnesses, widths, and construction materials. Choosing a twin tip ski should depend on the following factors.

### Skill Level

The first thing to think about is your skill level. If you’re new to skiing as a whole or just getting into park skiing, you’ll likely want a softer ski that’s easier to control and turn. If you’re an expert skier who’s spent a good amount of time in the park already, look for a stiffer ski that holds up better at high speeds and in more varied conditions.

### Ski Terrain Preferences

The second most important factor to consider is the type of terrain you like best. If you’re planning to spend most of your time in the terrain park, you'll want a dedicated park ski. If you just want to dip into the terrain park for a run or two, and mostly do small tricks off side hits on groomers, an all-mountain ski with a rocker profile and twin tips would be a better fit.

### Skiing Style

Every skier has a different style. Some skiers like to make fast, aggressive turns, which is best with a longer, stiffer twin tip. Other skiers prefer a more relaxed, laid-back cruise down the slopes, which is better matched with a softer, shorter twin tip.

### Budget

With how expensive ski gear can be, price is a crucial factor to consider. Some skiers looking for twin tips just want a ski to mess around in the park with, on days where there isn’t a ton of new powder. Other skiers want the highest-performance park ski that they can ride all the way to the X-Games. Depending on your needs, a higher price doesn’t always mean a better ski. Setting a budget and thinking about what you’ll primarily use this ski for can help you narrow down your choices.

With all that in mind, let’s check out my list of the best twin tip[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)!

## The Best Twin Tip Skis

### 1.[K2 Reckoner 92](https://www.curated.com/products/9450432/k2-reckoner-92-skis-2024-169-cm?ref=journal)/[K2 Women's Reckoner 92](https://www.curated.com/products/9453520/k2-reckoner-92-w-skis-women-s-2024-149-cm?ref=journal)

The K2 Reckoner 92 is a fantastic option for those looking for a ski with good performance all over the mountain that doesn’t drain the bank account. Both the men’s and women’s versions have a double barrel wood core, which keeps things light and durable, and a denser wood underfoot for more efficient energy transfer and power. They also have a fiberglass weave down the core, which provides extra rebound out of landings and keeps the ski stable at high speeds and when carving on hardpack. For those who plan to use these skis to lap the park all day, durable Twintech sidewalls make the edges and top sheets more resistant to impact damage from rails or the skis scraping against each other mid-jump. The only difference in the women’s version is that they have slightly less fiberglass, making them a bit lighter and more maneuverable for lightweight skiers. If you’re looking for a twin tip to practice park tricks, lap groomers, and explore some off-piste terrain, this is a great option.

### 2.[Head Oblivion 84](https://www.curated.com/products/9448329/head-oblivion-84-skis-2024-176-cm?ref=journal)

The Head Oblivion 84 are unisex skis specifically designed for park performance and skiers who can’t help themselves from doing a few tricks on the way to the bottom, no matter the terrain. They're a great choice for competition-oriented skiers [like Jesper Tjäder](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcLeUqbMsy1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D&ref=journal), or those really focusing on getting their park skills down. The Oblivion has a sandwich cap construction, which cuts down on weight edge for better balance and maneuverability on jumps, while still being durable enough to withstand hitting rails all day. The base is made with Head’s Tuff-Wall design, which makes them resistant to wear-and-tear, so you can shred on these for years to come. The most unique feature in the Oblivion is the innovative ISS (Independent Suspension System), a shock-absorbing system that dampens the impact of bumps and jumps, providing smoother rides and enhanced control. Whether you're working on park trips or spinning off an unexpected jump, these are a super durable option for any skier who has a more freestyle, playful ski style.

### 3.[Völkl Revolt 95](https://www.curated.com/pla/6382056/voelkl-revolt-95-skis-2023-173-cm?ref=journal)

The Völkl Revolt 95 is a very well-rounded twin tip ski that toes the line between all mountain and freestyle. This versatility makes it a great choice for any skier who doesn’t want to commit to a full park or trick ski, but still likes a playful ride. It’s designed with a multi-layer wood core that incorporates dense ash underfoot and flexible poplar in the tip and tail. This combo makes the Revolt feel energetic yet controlled, whether you’re taking it off jumps or trying to make some turns through light powder. The 95 mm waist width gives this ski a great balance of easy edge control on hardpack, and a bit of float in the new stuff. Overall, the Revolt performs well on most any kind of terrain you take it on and any type of snow conditions you might encounter. If you ski in areas that get more new snow, this ski also comes in a [104 mm waist width](https://www.curated.com/products/9452385/voelkl-revolt-121-skis-2024-191-cm?ref=journal), and it even comes in a [121 mm waist width option](https://www.curated.com/products/9452385/voelkl-revolt-121-skis-2024-191-cm?ref=journal), if you’re looking for a twin tip to strictly ride powder (more of a freeride ski). The wider this ski, the more float you get, though I wouldn’t recommend the 104 or 121 if you’re planning to ski mostly on piste. Even at the widest option, the Revolt carves better than a lot of similar width skis, thanks to Völkl’s dialed-in edge design, which grips well and accommodates a wide array of turn types from short and quick, to long and arcing. The Revolt is a unisex ski and a really approachable ride for intermediate skiers to expert skiers.

### 4.[K2 Poacher Skis](https://www.curated.com/products/9448917/k2-poacher-skis-2024-184-cm?ref=journal)/[K2 Midnight](https://www.curated.com/pla/6359372/k2-midnight-skis-women-s-2023-169-cm?ref=journal)

The K2 Poacher for men and Midnight for women are skis that cater to a broad range of skiers looking for an all-mountain ski that can do a few tricks and jumps. The Poacher has a core made from a combination of aspen and fir, which gives it a blend of strength (won’t break after one-too-many hard landings off the rails) and responsiveness (rely on it to be easily controlled when doing harder freestyle tricks). The Midnight is made with a full aspen core, which makes it a bit less stiff for lightweight riders, while still being strong and responsive. Both the Poacher and Midnight have full carbon fiber stringers throughout their length, which keeps the skis energetic out of turns and landings, and light enough to not weigh you down while you’re taking off. Both are great options for the intermediate to expert rider who wants a twin tip ski, but plans on exploring the whole mountain. The added stiffness from the carbon stringers makes them a bit stiffer, and thus hard to control for newer skiers.

### 5.[Armada ARV 94](https://www.curated.com/products/9371056/armada-arv-94-skis-2024-171-cm?ref=journal)/[Armada ARW 94](https://www.curated.com/products/9369136/armada-arw-94-skis-women-s-2024-157-cm?ref=journal)

The Armada ARV and ARW 94 were made for intermediate to advanced skiers looking for a fun ski that provides stability in the park, playfulness off piste, and enough camber to carve on hardpack. Both the men’s ARV 96 and women’s ARW 96 are made with a poplar-ash wood core, which keeps things light and poppy, with an almost surfy feel. They both have special heat-treated edges, which along with providing impact resistance and durability when hitting metal rails in the park, help carve up groomers and hardpack with ease. The ARV is built with Armada’s Smear Tech base, which gives a bit of rise and extra balance in the tip and tail, making it more likely to catch an edge in variable snow, during takeoffs, and when landing. The lack of metal laminates in both versions of this ski make it feel a bit shaky and unstable if you cruise high-speed groomers all day. But if you’re looking for a casual ride to take you all over the mountain, the ARV/ARW 96 is the perfect match.

### 6.[Faction Prodigy 1](https://www.curated.com/products/9449679/faction-prodigy-1-skis-2024-184-cm?ref=journal)/[Prodigy 1X](https://www.curated.com/products/9451259/faction-prodigy-1x-skis-women-s-2024-158-cm?ref=journal)

The men’s Faction Prodigy 1 and the women’s Faction Prodigy 1X are classic twin tip skis that you’ll see several of if you look closely at the skis in your local terrain park, or if you tune in for any of the Aspen X-Games. A fan favorite among park skiers, these skis both have a poplar wood core, which offers a medium flex pattern (the women’s is slightly softer) and great vibration absorption. Though both of these skis can handle all-mountain terrain, they’re most at home in the park or jumping off natural features. They both have an elliptical sidecut, which gives the ski a longer turn radius in waist and shorter radii in the top and tail. This combo lets you pivot fast and easily, making for easy turn initiation, and it allows for a wide range of turning styles. The edges of both versions are made from Faction’s XL 2.5 technology, which stacks extra steel on top of Faction’s already super-durable edges, for a bombproof ski edge that won’t break after a hard rail slide or impact when landing. While it’s not a great intro park ski due to its stiffness, the Prodigy line is great for intermediate to advanced skiers, who hang out in the park 75% of the time and ski the rest of the resort the other 25%, or advanced to expert freestyle skiers looking for a dedicated park ski. The Prodigy 1 and 1X are the narrowest options in this lineup with 88 mm underfoot, but if you want something slightly wider, this ski also comes in a 98 underfoot option ([Prodigy 2](https://www.curated.com/products/6416443/faction-prodigy-2-skis-2023-189-cm?ref=journal)and[2X](https://www.curated.com/products/6414451/faction-prodigy-2x-skis-women-s-2023-165-cm?ref=journal)), and even a 106 mm underfoot option ([Prodigy 3](https://www.curated.com/products/6415389/faction-prodigy-3-skis-2023-178-cm?ref=journal)and 3X).
