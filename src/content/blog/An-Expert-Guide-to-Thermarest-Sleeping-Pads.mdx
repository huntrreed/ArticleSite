title: An Expert Guide to Thermarest Sleeping Pads
---

Tl;dr\:Therm-a-Rest is a big name in the outdoor equipment scene, with sleeping pads being the product they are best known for. Therm-a-Rest offers a variety of different sleeping pad options for different types of campers and camping styles. By considering your camp style and needs, you can hone in on how much comfort, weight, and insulation you need in a sleeping pad. From there, Therm-a-Rest has many different technologies in their various pads to help you get a good night's rest on any camping trip.

I understand the importance of getting a good night's rest on every camping trip so you can get the most out of your time in nature. Nothing is worse than waking up after a night in the tent to find yourself too exhausted or sore to really enjoy the hikes, climbs, rides, or exploration that you had planned for the next day.

Hi, I’m Hunter, and I have been working in the outdoor industry for eight years now and camping for about 25 years. I have tried and tested almost every brand of sleeping pad out there, and my go-to comfort pad that I know I will always feel well rested after sleeping on is a Therm-a-Rest pad. They have a ton of thoughtful technology in their pads that can ensure you get the best sleep no matter what kind of camping you’re doing.

In this guide, I will help you understand all the ins and outs of Therm-a-Rest pads so that you can hit the road to your next camping destination with the peace of mind that you won’t be driving home a few days later sleep-deprived and dreaming of your mattress at home.
Let’s get into it!

## Why Therm-A-Rest?

Therm-a-Rest is a game-changer in the outdoor equipment world. Though they make a wide array of outdoor gear, including sleeping bags, quilts, camp chairs, pillows, ponchos, jackets, and more, they are the most well-known for their sleeping pads. Their company slogan, “Rest Better. Play Better.” says it all. You can’t fully enjoy all the outdoors has to offer if you’re running on minimal sleep from a night of tossing and turning.

Therm-a-Rest has had over 50 years to perfect their sleeping pad design, and over that time, they have come up with many technologies to keep you warm and comfortable no matter what kind of camping you plan on doing. They have mastered making low-weight pads for weight-conscious backpackers, durable pads that can withstand the wear and tear of heavy outdoor use, and comfortable pads that won’t have you lying awake in your tent, missing your bed at home.

Having stayed up to date on gear news over the last eight years of being in the outdoor industry, I can confidently say Therm-a-Rest is one of the most innovative brands out there on the sleeping pad market.

## What to Consider When Buying a Therm-A-Rest Sleeping Pad Product

Before you start perusing through the sleeping pad options Therm-a-Rest offers, there are a few questions you need to consider to narrow down what kind of pad you need. The following questions will help you make the right decision.

### 1. What Type of Camping Will You Be Doing?

You should have a pretty good idea of the type of camping you will be doing. Are you mainly car camping? If so, you can go for a really comfort-oriented sleeping pad. Are you mostly backpacking? For backpacking, you’ll want a lightweight, compact pad that’s easy to carry.

### 2. What Is the Appropriate R-Value for the Conditions You Camp in?

R-value is a measurement that determines a sleeping pad’s ability to resist heat loss, directly impacting how much insulation your sleeping pad will provide between you and the ground. Higher R-values are necessary for camping in colder conditions. In contrast, a lower R-value will work primarily for summer camping. Before looking for a pad, determine what weather and seasons you will primarily be camping in to choose a pad with the correct R-value.

Here are some broad ranges for R-values dependent on the seasons you’re camping in:

- Summer only:0.5-3
- Summer, Spring, and Fall:3-5
- Summer, Spring, Fall, and Winter: 5+

### 3. What’s Your Budget?

Understanding your budget is another essential part of ensuring you get the best pad for your needs without overspending or spending too little and ending up with a pad unsuitable for your camping situation. Luckily, Therm-a-Rest pads come in various price points to fit various budgets:

- Below $100\:Pads in this price range are pretty basic without too much padding or insulation. They are suitable for backpackers who want something lightweight and don’t care as much about comfort or car campers looking for something simple and cheap.
- $100-$200\:Offers a wide range of options, balancing comfort, weight, and insulation. These are better for more variable types of use and variable temperatures—a worthy investment for frequent campers.
- Above $200\:Top-of-the-line sleeping pads with extra comfort and high R-values. Great for ultralight backpackers who want something light but comfortable or campers who regularly camp in extremely cold weather.

### 4. Do You Have Specific Features or Health Needs to Consider?

Lastly, consider if there are any specific features you need in a sleeping pad or if you have any health concerns, such as back or neck pain or sleeping issues.

If you have back or neck pain, you’ll want to ensure you get a pad with plenty of padding so you don’t wake up the next morning with soreness that prevents you from being able to explore the area you’re in! If you have any issues sleeping, it’s a good idea to test your pad before you take off to your camp spot. Some camping pads can be a bit noisy or loud when you move around at night. As a light sleeper, I have woken myself up by tossing and turning on a loud pad plenty of times, and it puts a damper on the next day if I am exhausted.

In terms of special features, some sleeping pads are self-inflating pads, extra long, or have silicone feet on the underside of the pad to prevent it from moving around in your tent. If any of those sound useful to you, ensure you get a pad with that particular included feature!

## What Are the Different Types of Therm-a-Rest Sleeping Pads?

Now that you know some of the main questions to consider when searching for a Therm-a-Rest pad, let’s look at the different types of sleeping pads the company offers.

### 1. Car Camping Sleeping Pads

Car camping sleeping pads, or as Therm-a-Rest labels them, their “Camp and Comfort” line is designed with comfort as a top priority. They are thicker pads with more padding and are meant to primarily give you the most comfortable, best night’s sleep without concern for how heavy the pad is or how small it packs down.

- Benefits\:Thicker for extra comfortDurable, resists punctures, wear, and tearGenerally, the cheapest options
- Be Aware\:HeavierDon’t pack down as small as other types

### 2. Backpacking Sleeping Pads

Therm-a-Rests line of “Trek and Travel” pads are specific to campers looking for a sleeping pad to backpack with. These are still comfortable but prioritize low weight and the ability to pack into a smaller size rather than prioritizing comfort. They come in various insulation options and are typically more in the middle price range ($100-200). Even though comfort is not the top priority in these pads, they are still comfortable enough to get a great night’s sleep on, so if you are a car camper who is considering backpacking at some point in the future, it’s a great option that can serve as a dual purpose pad for both car camping and backpacking.

- Benefits\:Lightweight and compactVersatile, suitable for varied camping stylesGood balance between comfort and weight
- Be Aware\:Not as comfort-oriented as car camping padsMore expensive than car camping pads

### 3. Ultralight Sleeping Pads

Lastly, we have Therm-a-Rest’s ultralight line of sleeping pads or their “Fast and Light” line. Ultralight pads are even lighter than backpacking pads. They are meant for more minimalist backpackers or those doing long treks where bringing as little gear and weight is necessary. They are more expensive (generally $200-$300), come in an array of different R-values, and are typically not as comfortable as backpacking pads because the focus on low weight causes them to cut some of the extra padding that’s found in car camping pads and backpacking pads.

- Benefits\:Extremely lightweight and packableIncorporates advanced technologies for warmthIdeal for long-distance hiking and backpacking
- Be Aware\:Least comfort-oriented type of sleeping padTypically lose some durability for the sake of weightMost expensive

## Features to Look Out for When Buying a Therm-a-Rest Pad

A few technologies and construction features specific to Therm-a-Rest are helpful to know about as you peruse pad options. Let’s take a closer look at them!

- ThermaCapture Technology\:This reflective coating inside the pad traps radiant heat, which keeps the pad warmer. ThermaCapture has been a real game changer for cold individuals like myself because it’s efficient at retaining body heat without adding extra weight to the pad. It’s also a great feature if you’re doing much cold weather camping.
- Triangular Core Matrix\:This unique baffle construction inside Therm-a-Rest’s pads uses two layers of triangular baffles to help the sleeping pad feel stable as you sleep on it (prevents sinking into the pad or the feeling that you will roll off). It also aids the ThermaCapture technology in retaining body heat on especially cold nights. The Therm-a-Rest pads with the highest R-values will have both the Triangular Core Matrix construction and the ThermaCapture technology.
- WaveCore Construction\:If you’re not necessarily looking for the pad with the highest R-value, the WaveCore construction essentially does the same thing as the Triangular Core Matrix but in a lightweight package. Instead of triangular baffles, pads with WaveCore Construction have horizontal baffles, which still trap heat and provide a stable sleeping surface without the extra weight that comes with the two-tiered baffles in the Triangular Core Matrix technology.
- Pressure Mapping Technology\:Most Therm-a-Rest pads (aside from their full foam pads) incorporate this technology, which is built from biometric data that indicates where the highest pressure points are when laying on a pad. These high-pressure areas, such as the hips, shoulders, and neck, have a higher-density foam, whereas the rest of the pad has a low-density foam. This allows targeted cushioning in typical problem areas without making the rest of the pad too unnecessarily heavy. Pads with this feature are an especially great choice for any side sleepers!
- WingLock Valve\:These easy-to-use inflation valves make huffing and puffing from blowing up your pad a thing of the past. They allow you to inflate your pad three times faster than the typical inflation valve and allow one-way inflation, which prevents any air from escaping during the inflation process. When you’re ready to pack up your pad, it’s easy to switch the valve to “deflate mode,” which makes deflation much faster than on a classic valve. This feature makes setting up camp and taking down camp much easier.

## How to Choose the Right Therm-a-Rest Pad for You

We’ve covered a lot of information, but if you’re still not sure which sleeping pad from Therm-a-Rest is the exact right fit for you, don’t worry! Below, I have described three Curated customers, all with different camping styles and needs, that I have helped to find their ideal sleeping pad. I’ve given some information about each of them, some things they should look for in a pad, and some recommendations of Therm-a-Rest pads that would be a good fit for them.

### Rick: The All-Season Backpacker

Rick loves backpacking, no matter the weather or location. If he hears about a cool spot for backpacking, he will go check it out. He primarily looks for lightweight gear that can cut some ounces off his overall pack weight and fit in a compact stuff sack so it doesn’t take up much room in his backpack. Since he backpacks so often, he wants something high quality that will last for a long time. Due to the various types of weather he encounters on his treks, he also wants something versatile that can be used all year round.

Things Rick needs in a pad:

- Four-season warmth
- Lightweight and compact
- Comfortability since he’s typically a bit sore after his long days of trekking
- Durable enough for heavy use

Features to look for:

- High R-value
- WaveCore construction or Triangular Core Matrix technology for stability
- ThermaCapture for added warmth in winter

### Lane: The Occasional Car Camper

Lane enjoys escaping from the hustle and bustle of city life to camp at established campgrounds in her car. Weight and bulkiness aren’t a huge concern, but overall, she values comfort in a sleeping pad. Most of her camping trips are on the weekends in the spring or summer when the weather is warm. Lane needs a good night's sleep while camping so she doesn’t show up to work on Monday, exhausted from sleepless nights of car camping during her weekend getaways. Since most of her camping trips are shorter, she wants something easy to set up so she can minimize her time setting up her gear when she gets to camp and can maximize her available time to explore or hike.

Things Lane needs in a pad:

- Maximum comfort
- Easy set up and pack up

Features to look for:

- Well-padded and comfortable, possibly with Pressure Mapping technology
- Self-inflating capability
- Moderate R-value for three-season use in case it gets cold some evenings

### Jill: The Budding Camper

Jill recently moved to Denver from her hometown in Michigan. Growing up in Michigan, she would occasionally car camp and knew she liked camping, but moving to Denver has opened a whole world of possibilities in terms of new places to camp and new wilderness to explore. While Jill’s used to the comfort of car camping, she is curious about the world of backpacking. If invited on a backpacking trip, she would excitedly try it out. Jill camps whenever she can in the spring, summer, and fall.

Things Jill needs in a pad:

- Versatility for both car camping and backpacking
- Comfortable cushioning
- Reasonably lightweight for potential backpacking

Features to look for:

- StrataCore construction or NeoAir for a balance of comfort and weight
- SpeedValve design for quicker inflation
- Durability since her new home has more rugged terrain
