## My take

The Primus Profile 2 Burner stove is perfect for anyone who is car camping and looking to go the extra mile with camp dinners. It is really easy to use, has great heat distribution, and has made dinner in the backcountry much more enjoyable than it used to be when I’d just heat some hot water for a dehydrated meal.

## What I was looking for

I was looking for a two-burner stove that could make better camp meals than just dehydrated food or oatmeal. I had a little stove for backpacking and such at the time of buying this, but I had just built out the back of my truck and was going to live in it for a few months, so I wanted something fancier as I knew it wasn't sustainable just to make dehydrated meals for months.

I also wanted it to be durable so that I wouldn’t worry about it breaking or anything when I was in the backcountry and could just keep it in the truck without worrying that it would get too hot/cold and break.

## Why I chose this gear

I chose this product because I had heard good things about Primus, and it was a good size. There is also a version that comes with one burner and a hotplate/grill style cover on the other burner, but I don’t find myself grilling all that much, so I thought the two-burner would be a better option for me personally. The attachment for the propane is also really easy and straightforward, and the burner covers are removable so that it’s easy to keep the stove clean.

## What I love about it

- Durability\:It has done really well in terms of durability. This stove lives in my truck and gets banged around a bit, and it’s still kicking without any issues that make it unusable.
- Heat control\:It’s really easy to adjust the flame; it's just like a regular kitchen stove with a knob. It also cooks things super evenly; I have had issues in the past with friends' stoves only getting really hot on one part of the flame and leaving the rest cold, but that's not been the case with this, and the meals turn out as if I had cooked them on my stove at home.
- Stability\:It’s stable since it's larger and doesn’t rest on the fuel canister like some other stoves.
- Wind resistance\:It has a wind guard that protects it pretty well, and though it could be better, I have really only had issues with it twice, and it was incredibly windy, and I don’t think many stoves of this style would have done better.
- Ease of use\:It is really easy to use; if you have ever used a stove at home, you will be able to use this with no problem.
- Car Camping\:It is great for car camping, easy to set up, easy to take down, a good size, and will cook food evenly. The two-burner system is awesome, especially for those who don’t grill. I can easily warm up a tortilla on one burner while cooking burrito contents on the other. It’s a stellar car camping stove.

## Issues I’ve encountered

- Fuel Efficiency\:It’s not as fuel-efficient as some ultralight backpacking stoves, and I always make sure to unscrew the propane when not in use so that it doesn’t leak or anything. However, for a two-burner stove, it isn’t really to be expected that it would be ultra-efficient on fuel.
- Portability/Packability\:It is not that portable. It’s not really heavy or hard to lift or anything and does have a handle on the bottom, but it wouldn’t be useful for anything aside from car camping.
- It has an auto ignite button that I have never been able to get to work. I was about to leave, so I didn’t have time to deal with an exchange, so I never mentioned it or tried to get an exchange. I don’t think it was a durability issue. I light it with a lighter, and that has never caused me any problems.
- Backpacking\:No, I would never ever take this backpacking; it is way too big.

The coolest camping spot to make dinner in Mt. Hood National Forest!

## Favorite moment with this stove

My favorite moment with this stove was when I was living in my truck and in Mt. Hood National Forest. I had driven a lot that day and had a rough few days before with my pup getting into something she found at a previous camping spot. I was really tired and hungry and sick of driving. I pulled off on a dirt road and found the seriously most beautiful view of Mt. Hood, and set my stove up to make some pasta and veggies. I think food always tastes a little better when I’m camping because I have more time to focus on making it and I am outside, but this pasta was incredible and way better than any freeze-dried meal would have been after that long of an ordeal leading up to it. (Photo above is from that!)

## Value for the money vs. other options

This stove isn’t too expensive compared to others with a similar design and has lasted really well. It cooks my food evenly and is easy to use, so there is not a lot more I could ask for. The ignite button was a bummer, and I’m not sure if that was a quality issue or just a faulty one that I got, but it still works great without that, so in terms of value, I think this one is a good option.

## Final verdict

The Primus Profile Two-Burner Stove is an excellent option for car campers looking to step up their meals. I really haven’t had any issues with it or times that I was irritated with it being slow or faulty in bad weather or anything like that. It’s intuitive to use, is durable, and isn’t going to break the bank.
