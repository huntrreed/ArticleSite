title: The 8 Best Ultralight Sleeping Bags
---

When it comes to backpacking, every ounce of weight counts. Ultralight backpacking is all about shedding unnecessary weight from your gear to maximize your speed, agility, and endurance on the trail. One of the most critical things to dial in for any backpacker is their sleep system, which includes a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag. Unfortunately, many sleeping bags can be heavy and bulky to toss in a backpacking backpack, where space is pretty limited, which can be tiring to carry on long treks.

That's where ultralight sleeping bags come in, providing a lightweight and compact solution that won't weigh you down on the trail. In this guide, we'll explore the world of ultralight sleeping bags, examining the key features to consider when choosing one and providing recommendations for some of the best options on the market.

## Who Needs an Ultralight Sleeping Bag?

If you’re wondering if an ultralight sleeping bag is the right option for you, here are a few of the main people who would benefit from having an ultralight bag!

1. Ultralight backpackers\:People who are dedicated to reducing the weight of their gear as much as possible and willing to make sacrifices in comfort to do so. Ultralight backpackers often aim to cover long distances quickly, and an ultralight sleeping bag is a crucial part of their kit.
2. Thru-hikers\:People who undertake long-distance hikes, such as the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest Trail, where every ounce of weight counts. An ultralight sleeping bag can help them move more quickly and efficiently on the trail.
3. Minimalist travelers\:People who prefer to travel light and don't want to be weighed down by bulky gear. An ultralight sleeping bag is an essential item for those who want to travel with just a backpack and minimal belongings.
4. Adventure travelers\:People who like to explore remote areas and want to be able to carry everything they need on their backs. An ultralight sleeping bag is a valuable piece of gear for those who want to enjoy a comfortable night's sleep in the great outdoors without carrying unnecessary weight.

### Temperature Rating

Ultralight sleeping bags are available in a range of temperature ratings, from summer bags rated for warmer temperatures to four-season bags rated for below-freezing conditions. A sleeping bag's temperature rating is determined by the lowest temperature at which a person can comfortably sleep inside the bag, based on the bag's insulation and design. So choose a sleeping bag with a temperature rating appropriate for the climate and conditions you'll be camping in.

Here are the most common temperature rating ranges for sleeping bags:

- Summer bags\:Rated for temperatures above 35°F (2°C)
- Three-season bags\:Rated for temperatures between 20°F (-7°C) and 35°F (2°C)
- Winter bags\:Rated for temperatures below 20°F (-7°C)

It's important to note that temperature ratings are not standardized across all manufacturers, so a 20°F sleeping bag from one brand may not provide the same level of warmth as a 20°F sleeping bag from another brand. In addition, factors such as the quality and type of insulation, the shape of the bag, and the design of the hood and draft collar can all affect the warmth of a particular bag.

### Insulation Type

The two main types of insulation used in ultralight sleeping bags are down and synthetic. Down is lighter and more compressible but can lose its insulating properties when wet. Usually made of polyester, synthetic insulation is heavier and less compressible, but it retains warmth even when wet. Some down bags have a water-resistant or water-repellent down, such as DownTek, which has the lightweight/compressible features of classic down, but still retains some heat and insulation capabilities when wet.

### Fill Power

If you choose a down sleeping bag, look for one with a high fill power. Fill power or fill weight refers to the loft or fluffiness of the down, and higher fill power means more warmth with less weight.

### Weight and Packed Size

An ultralight sleeping bag's weight and packed size are important factors to consider, as they will affect how easy it is to carry on a backpacking trip. Therefore, look for a lightweight sleeping bag that packs down small.

### Ultralight Sleeping Bag Features

Some ultralight sleeping bags come with additional features. Here are some of the most common features you’ll see on an ultralight sleeping bag:

1. Shape\:Sleeping bags come in different shapes, including rectangular, mummy, and semi-rectangular. Mummy bags are more thermally efficient and lightweight, while rectangular bags offer more room for movement and are more comfortable.
2. Hood\:A hood is a part of the sleeping bag that covers your head and provides additional insulation. It is especially important for cold weather conditions. Some hoods have an elastic draw cord around the outside, allowing for a closer fit to keep cold air out.
3. Zipper\:The zipper allows you to open and close the sleeping bag. Some bags have a full-length zipper, which allows for easy ventilation, while some have a shorter zipper which can help retain heat.
4. Draft collar\:A draft collar is a tube of insulation that sits around the neck and prevents heat loss through the neck opening of the sleeping bag.
5. Draft tube\:A draft tube is a layer of insulation that sits behind the zipper and prevents cold air from seeping in.
6. Footbox\:The footbox is a part of the sleeping bag that is designed to fit around your feet and provide additional insulation.
7. Stuff sack\:A stuff sack is a bag that allows you to compress the sleeping bag for easier transport and storage. It can also protect the sleeping bag from moisture and dirt. Most sleeping bags come with a stuff sack.

Now that you understand some of the key features and differences in ultralight sleeping bags, let’s get into the list of the most recommended ones!
