## Who Is Head?

Head is a top name in the skiing industry, with a history dating back to its founding in 1950. The company was founded by Howard Head, an aeronautical engineer who applied his expertise to revolutionize ski design. Head quickly gained recognition for its strong emphasis on research and development, constantly striving to improve the skiing experience for professional athletes and recreational skiers.

Though Head makes high-quality[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)for professional and non-professional skiers, it’s worth mentioning that Head[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are one of the most popular brands among professional skiers. Many world-class athletes, including Olympic champions and World Cup winners, choose Head[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)for their competitions.

Head’s commitment to innovation and popularity among the top skiers in the world has made Head a trusted name in the skiing world. But if you’re not a professional skier, don’t worry! Their dedication to pushing boundaries and delivering exceptional products has resulted in a range of top-quality[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that cater to skiers of all levels, from beginners to Olympic athletes.

As mentioned, Head has been at the forefront of groundbreaking technology in the ski world. Here are a few noteworthy technologies and advancements that came from Head:

- Graphene Integration\:Head was the first ski manufacturer to incorporate graphene, a lightweight and very strong material, into their[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Graphene enhances the[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)' strength, stability, and responsiveness while maintaining a lightweight construction. It is now a commonly used material in ski construction across many brands.
- Intelligence™ Technology\:Head's Intelligence™ technology utilizes a network of piezoelectric fibers integrated into the ski's construction which actively adapt to changes in terrain and skiing conditions, providing improved responsiveness and vibration damping for a smoother and more controlled ride.
- KERS Technology\:Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) technology was originally used in Formula One race cars, and Head introduced it in their[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)in 2011. KERS technology stores energy generated during turns and releases it at the end, delivering an extra power boost and acceleration.
- ERA 3.0\:ERA 3.0 combines technology elements by Head, including a rocker profile, progressive radius, and intelligent technology integration. This blend optimizes the ski's performance in different snow conditions and enhances maneuverability and stability.
- Super Light Weight Distribution\:Head employs advanced engineering techniques to achieve a balanced and lightweight distribution of materials in their[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), reducing swing weight, enhancing maneuverability, and improving overall skiing dynamics.

These are just a few examples of the innovative technologies and advancements that Head has pioneered in ski construction. Their continuous pursuit of cutting-edge solutions ensures that Head delivers exceptional[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)no matter your ski skill level or style.

Now that you know the basics of their construction methods and materials, let’s look at the top eight Head[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)!

## The 8 Best Head[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

### 1.[Head Kore 105](https://www.curated.com/products/6588305/head-kore-105-ski-2023-177-cm?ref=journal)

###

The Head Kore 105 is a versatile all-mountain ski with incredible performance in various conditions. It features Head's innovative Graphene-KOROYD-Carbon Sandwich Cap construction, which combines the lightweight and strength-enhancing properties of graphene with the responsive and dampening characteristics of KOROYD. This construction ensures a stable and agile ride while reducing weight for effortless maneuverability. The Kore 105 excels in powder and off-piste terrain, with a wide waist and tip/tail rocker for excellent floatation and easy turn initiation, though it can still carve up the groomers when the time comes. This ski is best for advanced to expert skiers looking to explore a bit of the whole mountain, and it’s light enough that it's a popular option for a resort/backcountry crossover ski.

### 2.[Head Kore 93](https://www.curated.com/products/6586347/head-kore-93-ski-2023-184-cm?ref=journal)

###

The narrower version of the popular Kore 105, the Head Kore 93, offers similar construction and performance in a more agile package. It is designed for skiers who prefer a narrower waist and want a ski that excels on both groomed runs and off-piste adventures. The Kore 93 features the same Graphene-KOROYD-Carbon Sandwich Cap construction, making it an agile and stable ride even at high speeds. Though it can handle some fresh powder with no problem, the Kore 93 really shines when carving on hardpack. For the skier who likes to carve groomers and occasionally take a run or two off-trail, the Kore 93 will be an awesome ride.

### 3.[Head Kore 97 W](https://www.curated.com/products/6586353/head-kore-97-w-ski-2023-163-cm?ref=journal)

###

The Head Kore 97 W is a women-specific ski that combines performance and versatility for all-mountain exploration. It shares the same construction technology as the Kore 105 and 93, utilizing Graphene-KOROYD-Carbon Sandwich Cap construction. It’s slightly lighter and softer than the male versions, making for a smoother ride for women skiers that tend to be a bit lighter weight. The 97mm waist makes it agile enough on groomers and floaty and maneuverable on off-piste terrain. With a women-specific design and flex pattern, the Kore 97 W offers precise control and stability, allowing intermediate to expert women skiers to tackle various conditions confidently.

### 4.[Head Kore 99](https://www.curated.com/products/6588311/head-kore-99-ski-2023-170-cm?ref=journal)

###

The Head Kore 99 is a versatile all-mountain ski that balances width and agility. The midpoint of the Head Kore 105 and Head Kore 93 regarding waist width, the 99 is a perfect true all-mountain ski for skiers who spend 50% of their time on trail and 50% off trail. The 99mm waist offers excellent float in powder while remaining nimble on groomed runs. The Kore 99 shares the same innovative Graphene-KOROYD-Carbon Sandwich Cap construction as its siblings in the Kore series and delivers lightweight performance and stability. Its moderate tip/tail rocker enhances maneuverability and ease of turn initiation, while the camber underfoot provides a reliable edge grip on harder snow.

### 5.[Head Oblivion 79](https://www.curated.com/products/9527174/head-oblivion-79-skis-2023-163-cm?ref=journal)

###

A freestyle ski built for skiers who love to hit the terrain park and master tricks in the air, the Oblivion 79 is designed to handle the demands of freestyle skiing, offering durability and responsiveness. It features a versatile camber profile that delivers reliable edge hold and pop, and a responsive wood core that gives the rider efficient power transmission during both takeoff and landing. Whether you're hitting jumps, sliding rails, or taking on the halfpipe, the Head Oblivion provides the performance and maneuverability needed for freestyle skiers.

### 6.[Head Shape V2](https://www.curated.com/products/6588326/head-shape-v2-skis-pr-11-gw-bindings-2023-170-cm?ref=journal)

###

For skiers working on their parallel turns and exploring groomed terrain, the Head Shape V2 will give you an easy breezy experience on the slopes. It is an introductory carving ski designed for skiers looking to refine their skills on trail. These[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have a deep sidecut, wider tip and tail, and a narrower waist (a v-shape—where they got their name!). This shaping makes them quick and snappy coming out of turns. They also have Head’s ERA 3.0 technology that makes turning effortless, and the 70mm waist width makes it easy to engage the edge in turns. The Shape V2 is an excellent choice for beginners and progressing intermediates looking to hone their carving skills. (These[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are sold as a set with bindings!)

### 7.[Head Pure Joy SLR](https://www.curated.com/products/9526076/head-pure-joy-slr-skis-joy-9-gw-bindings-women-s-2023-163-cm?ref=journal)

###

This one's for beginner women skiers working on developing their skills and building confidence on the slopes! With its forgiving flex and lightweight construction, the Pure Joy SLR ski offers an accessible, no-stress experience on the slopes. It features Head's Super Light Weight Distribution technology, ensuring a responsive ride. It provides stability and control, allowing beginners to progress and improve their skiing abilities comfortably. It’s on the narrower side, so not well suited for going off-trail or skiing in new snow, but a great intro ski for any woman new to the sport. (These are sold as a set with bindings!)

### 8.[Head Absolut Joy SLR Pro](https://www.curated.com/products/6675021/head-absolut-joy-slr-pro-skis-joy-9-gw-slr-bindings-women-s-2023-163-cm?ref=journal)

###

Still a frontside/on-piste oriented ski, the Head Absolut Joy is a step up from the Pure Joy for intermediate to advanced skiers who want an easy, more casual ride as they progress into different terrain and more variable snow. The ski features a slightly wider waist compared to the beginner-friendly Pure Joy, providing enhanced stability and floatation in soft snow. The Absolut Joy incorporates Head's Super Light Weight Distribution technology, making turning easy and preventing the tips and tails from catching in softer snow. It excels on groomed runs, offering precise edge control and quick turn initiation.

For the women skier who is too advanced for beginner-oriented[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)but doesn’t want to venture off-piste much, the Absolut Joy will be an absolute joy to cruise around on groomers, no matter the conditions. (The Absolut Joy SLR Pro[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are sold as a set with bindings!)
