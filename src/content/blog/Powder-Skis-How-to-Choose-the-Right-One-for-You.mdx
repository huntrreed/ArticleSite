title: 'Powder Skis: How to Choose the Right One for You'
---

TL;DR\:Having a powder ski in your ski quiver is a must if you tend to ski off-piste in areas with a lot of fresh snow. When buying powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), prioritize waist width (105mm or wider), flex, and a rocker profile that helps the ski float better in new snow. Many[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have powder-specific technology that makes them handle turning and floating in powder better, but be sure to get a powder ski that matches your skiing skill level, the terrain you’re most commonly skiing, and the type of skiing you like to do!

Having skied and lived in Utah since I was young, it’s hard not to fall in love with powder skiing! But there’s nothing worse than having a deep powder day and being on the wrong pair of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). I’ve had my fair share of surprise powder days where I have been on a ski that’s too heavy, too skinny, and doesn’t turn well in deep snow. Soaring and floating over the deep stuff on a wide, light pair of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)is an incredible feeling. It’s a feeling that I hope every ski enthusiast gets an opportunity to experience, and the first step towards getting there is having the right gear. That’s why I’m so excited to share this guide on choosing the right powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)with you today, so let’s jump in!

## What Are Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)?

When it comes to skiing powder, not just any ski will cut it. You want a ski that can float well on top of the new snow and turn easily in deep, heavy snow. That’s where powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)come in. A powder ski is a type of ski specifically designed for skiing in deep, fresh snow. It's wider than a typical all-mountain ski, often around 108mm+ at the waist, which helps it float on top of the snow rather than sinking in.

Powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)also usually have a rocker (curved up) design at both the tip and tail, so you can turn on a dime without catching in the snow. Compared to carving[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)or all mountain[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are generally sized a bit longer, providing additional floatation.

## What to Consider When Buying Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

There are a few things to consider when narrowing down which powder ski is the best for you. The best overall powder ski for your skiing style will be very different from the best for someone else, so let’s look at the questions to ask yourself before deciding on a ski!

### 1. Where Will You Be Skiing Most Often?

Think about the terrain and conditions of the ski areas you frequent. Are you hitting up deep powder havens like backcountry bowls or tree runs? Or do you mostly stick to groomed slopes with occasional powder days? It’s also helpful to familiarize yourself with where you most frequently ski. For example, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) gets powder days, but the snow is a bit wetter and heavier than in Montana, where there is more snowfall but the snow is a bit lighter. If you are skiing in the PNW more often, maneuverability might be the priority in a powder ski. If it’s somewhere more like Montana, you’ll want to prioritize float. Knowing where you'll be skiing most often helps determine the type of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that suit your needs.

### 2. What Is Your Skiing Ability?

Be honest with yourself about your skiing ability. Are you a seasoned pro or more of an intermediate skier? Powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)come in various designs, some catering to advanced skiers who like to charge hard, while others offer forgiveness and playfulness for those still mastering their technique. Picking[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)appropriate for your skill level will guarantee that you get a ski that keeps you smiling on the deep days instead of something that feels too difficult to maneuver and leaves you exhausted and ready to hit the lodge after just one powder run.

### 3. What Type of Skiing Do You Usually Do?

Consider your preferred style of skiing. Do you love weaving through trees, hitting natural features, and enjoying playful turns? Or do you enjoy laying down powerful, high-speed arcs on open slopes? Your skiing style influences the type of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)you'll want, as different[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)excel in different situations.

### 4. Are Any Specific Features or Technologies in the Ski That Enhance Powder Performance?

Keep an eye out for any innovative features or technologies that enhance the ski's powder performance. Examples include specific rocker profiles, carbon or metal reinforcement, or unique shapes designed to increase flotation. These features can significantly improve your powder skiing experience, so do some research and see if any stand out to you.

### 5. What Length Should You Choose?

The length of your powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)can impact their performance. Longer[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)generally offer better stability and floatation in deep snow, while shorter[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)tend to be more maneuverable. Consider your height, weight, skiing ability, and the type of terrain you'll be tackling to determine the optimal ski length for your needs. You should get a powder ski a few centimeters longer than you would typically get in an all-mountain ski. Each powder ski comes in various sizes, so this is something to consider after you have narrowed down the answers to the questions above and before deciding on a ski!

### 6. How Much Should Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)Cost?

Lastly, consider the cost. The cost of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)can vary greatly depending on the brand, technology, and construction quality. Set a budget range you're comfortable with and explore options within that range. Remember that higher-priced[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)often come with advanced features and superior materials, but you can still find great options at more affordable prices.
Consider the long-term value and durability of the[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)as well. There may be a cheaper option that can get you through two seasons or so, but if you’re an avid skier looking for something to last a long time, it will be cheaper, in the long run, to invest in a good pair of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)now as opposed to upgrading after a year or two.

By pondering these questions and considerations, you'll be equipped to make an informed decision when buying your perfect pair of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal).

## What Are the Different Types of Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)?

As we’ve mentioned, powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)differ from traditional[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)in that they are wider, have a more pronounced rocker profile, and typically feature a softer flex to allow for more playful maneuvers. But all powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are not the same, and each type has various features that cater to the skier’s individual preferences, skill levels, and different powder conditions. Let's dive into the benefits and downsides of different types of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)in the powder category!

### All-Mountain Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

As the name suggests, all-mountain powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are designed to handle various conditions, including powder. They are basically all-mountain[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), but on the wider side and more geared toward powder skiing and off-piste skiing as opposed to regular all-mountain[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), which are 50/50 suitable for on-piste and off-piste terrain. They have a moderate waist width and a mix of rocker and camber, allowing for good performance on both groomed slopes and in powder.

- BenefitsMost versatile type of powder skiBetter at handling carving and groomed runs compared to other types of powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)Offer a balanced combination of stability and maneuverability
- Keep in MindWon’t handle extremely deep powder as well as specialized powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)Not as playful or floaty as wide as dedicated powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)Can be less responsive and precise in aggressive skiing

### Traditional Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

Traditional powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are designed specifically for deep snow conditions. They are typically the widest type of[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), with a waist width often exceeding 110mm and a large rocker (upturned tip and tail) to promote floatation and maneuverability in powder. They usually have a softer flex, which gives them a playful feel in soft snow. However, their width and rocker can be challenging to handle on groomed or hardpack conditions.

- BenefitsExcellent floatation in deep snowEasy maneuverability and surfy-feel make powder turns easyExcellent stability and smoothness in soft snow conditions
- Keep in MindNot as versatile for varying snow conditionsCan be cumbersome on groomed runsExtensive rocker and soft flex can make these[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)feel unstable at high speeds or on hard snow

### Freeride Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

Freeride powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are built for off-piste adventures and deep powder days. They often have a wider waist, a generous rocker in the tip and tail, and a stiffer flex compared to traditional powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Their stiffer flex makes them harder to steer for newer or intermediate skiers, so these are best suited for advanced or expert skiers.

- BenefitsSuperior flotation and stability in deep powderExcellent performance in variable snow conditionsVersatile enough for both powder and freeride skiing
- Keep in MindWill feel less nimble and playful compared to narrower optionsMay require more effort in tight or technical terrainLess suitable for groomed slopes, hard-packed snow, or newer skiers

### Touring Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

This type of powder ski is specifically designed for backcountry skiing and ski touring. They are lightweight, making it easy for the skier to walk uphill with them, yet still provide good performance in powder, typically featuring a wider waist for flotation. The lower weight typically means they aren’t as stable for variable, hard-packed snow, so designated touring powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)will not perform as well doing resort laps where you might need to carve over hard-packed snow, crud, or ice.

- BenefitsLightweight construction for efficient uphill travelGood flotation in powder for backcountry adventuresVersatile enough to handle varied snow conditions during tours
- Keep in MindLess stable at high speeds due to lighter constructionLimited suitability for resort skiing or groomed slopes

##

### Big Mountain Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

The widest of all the powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are big mountain[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Big mountain powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)are built for aggressive skiing in steep and challenging terrain, including deep powder. They are very similar to freeride[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)but typically have a wider waist, aggressive rocker profiles, and a stiffer flex compared to freeride[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Again, not the best option for intermediate or newer skiers, but great for expert or advanced skiers looking to chase big lines.

- BenefitsExcellent stability and control in challenging conditionsHigh-performance[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)for aggressive and fast skiingBest flotation and maneuverability in deep powder
- Keep in MindWill be less maneuverable in tight or technical terrainWill require more energy and effort due to stiffer flex, so not great for non-advanced or expert skiersLess versatility for non-powder conditions or groomed slopes

##

### Twin-Tip Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

Twin-tip powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have a symmetrical shape with a rocker in the tip and tail, originally popular among freestyle and park riders. Twin-tip powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)offer a playful and versatile option for powder skiing, allowing for easy switch skiing and creative maneuvers over bumps, cliffs, or other natural features.

- BenefitsPlayful and maneuverable for tricks and jumps in powderEasy switch skiing and landing in both regular and reverse directionsVersatile[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)suitable for freestyle-oriented powder skiing
- Keep in MindTwin-tip design may compromise performance in deep powder, as the upturned tail can sink.Less ideal for high-speed or aggressive skiing

## Features to Look for in Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

Let's chat about the essential features and criteria to look for in a powder ski.

### Width and Length

The width of a ski, especially at its "waist" (the narrowest point), plays a major role in how well it floats on powder. You'll typically want a waist width of at least 105mm for powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal). Wider[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)of 115mm+ widths offer better flotation in deep powder. While narrower 100mm to 110mm balances powder performance and versatility on groomed slopes.

Longer[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)offer better float in deep snow. But, it's essential to balance this with manageability. Very long[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)can be challenging to control.

### Rocker

A rocker, also known as reverse camber, is a ski design where the tip and sometimes the tail are raised, making the ski look a bit like a banana. This helps[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)float in deep snow, making them more turn maneuverable. Some[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)have a full rocker, while others have a tip rocker or a combination of tip and tail rocker. The downside of a pure rocker ski is the flat surface underfoot is a bit less stable on firmer surfaces, such as groomed runs or ice.

### Flex

The flex or stiffness of the ski affects its handling. The softer flex makes a ski more forgiving and playful, while a stiffer flex provides better stability and control at high speeds. If you’re just getting into powder skiing, a softer flex will be a better option, and if you are more advanced and looking to charge hard lines, a stiffer ski will be a better option. The flex you want will also somewhat depend on what kind of terrain you’re in, as we briefly discussed above. Softer will make tight turns in trees easier, whereas something stiffer would be more suitable for big, open bowls.

### Taper

This refers to the gradual narrowing of the ski from the tip or tail toward the waist. In powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), a tapered tip can help prevent the ski from diving into the snow, while a tapered tail allows the ski to release from turns more easily.

### Construction

A ski's materials and construction methods can significantly impact its performance and longevity. Look for[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)with high-quality bases and durable topsheets. Lightweight wood cores are commonly used in powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)for their good strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber or titanium layers can add stiffness without much weight. Here are some examples of materials often used in powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal):

1. Carbon Fiber\:Carbon fiber provides strength and stiffness while reducing weight, increasing responsiveness and maneuverability.
2. Fiberglass\:Fiberglass adds durability, torsional stiffness, and responsiveness to the[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal), enhancing stability and power transmission.
3. Wood Core\:Wood cores offer a natural and lively feel, providing a good balance of stability, dampening, and energy transfer. Maple, ash, and poplar wood core are the most common because of their low weight and high strength.
4. Titanal\:Titanal (aluminum alloy) layers provide excellent dampening properties and stability, enhancing the ski's ability to handle variable conditions and high speeds.
5. Polyurethane\:Polyurethane materials in the ski's construction absorb vibrations, improving comfort and reducing fatigue on rough or bumpy terrain.
6. ABS Sidewalls\:ABS sidewalls enhance edge hold and durability, allowing for precise and powerful turns in various snow conditions.
7. Rubber Dampening\:Rubber dampening, usually present in the tips and tails, absorb vibrations, providing a smoother ride and improving overall ski performance.

Although this is quite a long list, it’s not exhaustive. But, once you keep these features in mind, it will be a lot easier to find the powder[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)that are perfect for you.

## Features to Avoid in Powder[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)

Choosing a powder ski depends on snow conditions and personal skiing style; some features might not be ideal for your specific attributes or needs. So, since we’ve covered the features to look for, let’s talk about some potential drawbacks. Here are a few things to be cautious about:

1. Narrow Waist\:While narrow[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)might work well on groomed or hard-packed snow, they will likely sink in deep powder. If you're specifically looking for a powder ski, avoid those with a narrow waist, typically less than 105mm.
2. Full Camber\:A full camber design, where the middle of the ski is raised off the ground when unweighted, is great for hard snow conditions due to enhanced edge grip. However, it's not ideal for powder as it can make it harder to float and turn.
3. Heavy[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)\:While some weight can benefit stability, particularly at high speeds, overly heavy[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)can be cumbersome and exhausting, particularly in deep powder or if you have to hike in the backcountry.
4. Stiff Tails:[Skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)with stiff tails can “lock” you into turns, making it more difficult to release the tail in deep snow. This can reduce maneuverability in powder, where you often want to pivot and smear your turns.

While innovation is generally good, be wary of brand-new, untested technologies or features that haven't been proven in real-world conditions. It's usually best to stick with tried-and-true designs and technologies, consult a Curated Skiing Expert, or demo the[skis](https://www.curated.com/c/skis?ref=journal)you’re considering before jumping on the latest trend.
