title: An Expert Guide to Portable Camping Showers
---

Are you planning a camping trip and wondering how you'll stay clean and refreshed without access to a traditional shower? Enter the world of camping showers! Portable and convenient, camping showers offer a refreshing and relaxing way to wash off the day's dirt and sweat while enjoying the great outdoors. But with so many different types and features available, choosing the right camping shower can be overwhelming. That's where our expert guide comes in! We'll walk you through the different types of camping showers, key features to look for, and offer tips for using and maintaining your shower to ensure it lasts for many camping trips to come.

For my first 20 or so years of camping, I had never used a shower. But as I started to go on longer and longer trips, and adopted a dog, I started to see how useful a portable shower was! So pack your towel and shampoo, and let's dive into the wonderful world of camp showers!

##

## What Is a Portable Camping Shower?

Portable camping showers or portable outdoor showers are compact and lightweight self-contained shower systems designed for use in outdoor environments. It allows campers and hikers to clean themselves and their gear while on the go. They consist of a water reservoir, a long hose, and a nozzle. These showers can be powered by solar energy, batteries, or manual pumps, and come in a range of sizes and designs.

Aside from taking a full shower, they are great for washing your feet off before getting into your tent, washing your pup if they roll in something when you're on a trip, or even doing dishes or rinsing gear off. It’s always nice to get in a full shower after being outside for several days on a camping trip, but they have a ton of other purposes aside from just showering!

### What Will You Be Using It For?

This might seem like a silly question, but different campers purchase showers for different reasons. I personally bring my shower almost every time I go camping because I have a dog who occasionally likes to roll in deer poop! I don’t typically need to use the shower, but I always have it on hand along with some dog shampoo or soap so I can wash her mid-camping trip if I need to. I have used it for showering myself on longer trips, but I mainly use it for her, which means I need something that packs away easily, and I don’t need a huge water reservoir. Other campers just want a shower for rinsing off their feet in muddy conditions, which would also really not require a large water reservoir. Some people want a shower for an easier time doing their camp dishes.

If you are looking to use your camping shower to take a full shower for you and a few other people, you’ll want something with a larger reservoir, and that has a higher, more consistent water pressure.

### What Type of Weather and Areas Will You Be Using It In?

The next thing to think about is where you will be using the shower. If you will be using it primarily in the warm months, you might not need something that is preheated, since you can heat it with the sun, or even use it with warm or colder water instead of hot water. If you are using it in colder temps or when the sun isn’t out, you will want to look for something that can heat up on its own such as an electric shower.

You should also consider where you are using it geographically. If you are going to be off-grid for a long time without a readily available water source, you will want something with a larger reservoir so you can use it several times without needing to refill the water. If you have a water source available or plan on going into town often, you can opt for something smaller.

### How Easy Is It to Use?

Some showers are a bit complicated to use. Make sure you get something that is easy to use and not a pain in the butt to set up and take down. The first shower I got was fairly easy to use, but so difficult to fill up since the hole for the water to go in was tiny and the walls of the shower were soft, so it would constantly spill out when I was filling it.

### What’s Your Budget?

Camping showers can range in price from around $40 to upwards of $500 for fancy, high-tech models. The more expensive showers have a lot more features and will generally last a long time, but personally are way fancier than I would ever need. Consider your needs, what you will be using it for, how often you’ll use it, and what features you need when determining how much you want to spend!

## Types of Portable Camping Showers

### Solar Showers

Solar camping showers use the power of the sun to heat water stored in a bag or tank. The water is heated by the sun's energy—which is absorbed by the black material on the bag or tank—and can be used for showering. Solar camping showers are environmentally friendly and do not require electricity or fuel. Solar showers are usually gravity-fed, but can also be pressurized.

Benefits:

- Eco-friendly and cost-effective
- Lightweight and easy to transport
- Can provide warm water even in remote locations

Be Aware:

- Water temperature can be inconsistent depending on weather conditions and how long
- Can take a long time to heat up
- Solar showers require sunlight to heat the water, which may not be available in all locations.

### Gravity-Fed Showers

Gravity-fed camping showers use the force of gravity to move water from a bag or tank to a showerhead. The bag or tank is filled with water and hung with a handle from a tree or other high point, and the water flows through a hose and showerhead via gravity. Gravity-fed camping showers are easy to use and require no electricity or fuel.

Benefits:

- Simple and easy to use
- Lightweight and portable
- Do not require electricity or fuel

Be Aware:

- Water pressure can be inconsistent
- Water temperature can fluctuate

### Pump/Pressurized Showers

Pump or pressurized camping showers use a pump or pressurization system to create water pressure. Usually, this is either a hand pump or a foot pump which is connected to the water reservoir. Water is pumped or pressurized through a hose and showerhead to provide a consistent flow of water for showering. These showers can be used with natural water sources or pre-filled tanks. Many pump showers are also solar showers, so it’s possible to get hot water if the weather cooperates.

Benefits:

- Provides consistent water pressure
- Can be used with different water sources
- Some models have rechargeable batteries for convenience

Be Aware:

- Requires more effort than a gravity shower since they need to be pumped or pressurized
- May require electricity or batteries
- Typically more expensive than gravity showers

### Battery, Electricity, or Propane-Powered Camping Showers

Battery, electric, and propane-powered camping showers use a battery, electric power or propane gas to heat water and provide water pressure. These showers can provide hot water on demand and are ideal for cold climates. They are also usually bigger and require more setup since you’ll either need to plug them in, charge the batteries, or carry propane tanks to power them.

Benefits:

- Provides consistent water pressure and temperature
- Can provide hot water despite the weather

Be Aware:

- Heavier and bulkier than other types of camp showers
- Requires some fuel source to operate
- More expensive than other types of camping showers

## Features to Look Out for When Buying a Portable Camping Shower

### Water Capacity

Water capacity is an important consideration when choosing a camping shower because it determines how many showers you can take before refilling. The water capacity of a camping shower varies depending on the type and model of the shower. Some camping showers have a capacity of just a few gallons, while others can hold up to 20 gallons of water or more.

The water capacity you need will depend on several factors, such as the number of people using the shower, the length of your camping trip, and your personal preferences. For example, if you are camping alone for a weekend, a small shower with a capacity of 5 liters may be sufficient. However, if you are camping with a group of people or going on a longer trip, a larger shower with a capacity of 10-20 liters may be more practical.

It's also important to consider how you will refill the shower when the water runs out. Some showers can be refilled by natural sources around your camping area, such as a river or stream, while others need to be filled with filtered water, so you may need to carry an extra tank or find a water pump in a nearby town that has filtered water.

### Portability

Since you are going to be using this shower on camping trips, portability is also important to consider. Some electric and battery-powered showers are large and bulky, which can be annoying to lug around and pack in and out of the car. Many gravity showers or pump showers can pack down pretty small into a stuff sack, making them easier to travel with and bring along on a backpacking trip if that’s what you were looking to use it for.

### Heating Capabilities

If you are planning on using your shower for mostly the sunny, summer months, a solar shower is a great option since it heats up on its own when in direct sunlight. If you are using your shower on colder camping trips in the late fall/early spring or even the winter, you will want to look for something that is self-heating such as an electric shower that preheats your water.

### Water Pressure

Water pressure is also important to take into consideration when choosing a camping shower because it determines the flow of water and how effective the shower is at cleaning. Different types of camping showers have different water pressure systems, and the pressure can vary based on the type and model of the shower.

Gravity-fed showers typically have lower water pressure, as they rely on gravity to power the flow of water. These types of showers are great for rinsing off after a swim or cleaning off mud and dirt, but they may not be powerful enough to fully wash your hair or body.

Pump or pressurized camping showers have higher water pressure since they have a pressurized system to force water through the showerhead at a higher pressure, providing a more powerful stream of water. This makes them better suited for longer showers or for washing hair and bodies more thoroughly.

Battery, electric, or propane-powered camping showers also typically have high water pressure and provide a more consistent stream of water. These types of showers are ideal for longer camping trips or for those who want the convenience of a more traditional shower experience while camping.

### Durability

You want to ensure that the shower is built to last and can withstand the rigors of outdoor use. Here are some things to consider when looking at durability and materials:

- Material\:Look for a shower made from durable materials such as heavy-duty PVC, nylon, or silicone. These materials can withstand the wear and tear of outdoor use and are resistant to punctures, tears, and abrasions.
- Construction\:Consider how the shower is constructed and whether the seams are reinforced or welded for added durability.
- UV resistance\:If you're considering a solar shower, look for a model with UV-resistant materials that can withstand extended exposure to sunlight without degrading or deteriorating.
- Pump or battery durability\:If you're considering a pump or battery-powered shower, ensure that the pump or battery is durable and can withstand extended use and exposure to the elements.

### Ease of Use and Cleaning

Ease of use and cleaning are other important features to watch for when you’re shopping for a camping shower. Look for a shower with a user-friendly design that makes it easy to control the water flow and temperature. Some showers come with features like on/off switches and temperature gauges that make them more convenient to use. Also be sure to test your shower at home before taking it into the backcountry so that you can watch a video, or ask an Expert how to use it if you can’t figure it out!

Ease of cleaning is also important since your shower will likely get dirty using it outdoors all the time. Showers with simple designs and minimal parts are usually easier to clean than those with complex systems. Look for a shower that is made from materials that are easy to clean, like PVC or nylon. These materials are usually waterproof and can be wiped down with a damp cloth. Consider purchasing a shower with a detachable shower head or hose as this makes it easier to clean the inside of the shower and prevent mold and mildew from growing.

Proper cleaning and maintenance will ensure that your shower stays in good condition for future trips!

### Accessories

Consider if any additional accessories are important to you. Some camping showers are sold as a kit with shower tents or a shelter to provide some privacy. Others may have included LED lighting on them for easy use in the dark. There are an array of different accessories that can be included in showers, so if you have a specific use in mind, take that into account!
