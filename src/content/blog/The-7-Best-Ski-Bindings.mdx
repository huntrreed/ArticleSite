title: The 7 Best Ski Bindings
---

Are you ready to hit the slopes for this season? Before you buckle up your boots and grab your skis, let's talk about a crucial piece of equipment that often goes unnoticed but plays a vital role in your skiing experience: ski bindings.

Now, I know what you might be thinking. Bindings? Do they matter that much? They do! Ski bindings are the unsung heroes of your skiing setup, providing you with safety, control, and the freedom to carve up those mountains with confidence.

But why should you care about ski bindings, you ask? Picture this: you're racing down the slope, the wind whipping through your hair, and suddenly, you catch an edge and take a tumble. This is where ski bindings swoop like your trusty sidekick, releasing your boots from the skis to prevent unnecessary injuries. They're your silent protectors, offering that crucial blend of safety and performance that allows you to push your limits on the mountain.

Whether you’re new to the sport or have been a lifelong skier, choosing the right binding can make a huge difference in your skiing experience. In this Expert Guide, we will dive into all the details of ski bindings. First, we will briefly go over a few factors to keep in the back of your mind as you’re on the hunt for bindings, such as the different types of bindings, what DIN means, and compatibility with ski boots and skis. And then, we will dive into our list of the top recommended bindings for every type of skiing, from backcountry touring to resort laps. So let’s get started!

## Factors to Consider When Choosing Ski Bindings

Before we start, let's dive into the nitty-gritty of ski bindings. When it comes to picking the perfect bindings, there are a few key factors you need to consider.

### Types of Bindings

First off, there are different types of bindings to choose from. There's the classic Alpine binding, which is your go-to for resort skiing. Then we have touring bindings designed for skiers who like to venture into the backcountry. And if you're looking for the best of both worlds, we've got hybrid bindings that cater to all-mountain skiing, combining the features of both Alpine and touring bindings. It's all about finding the right match for your skiing style.

### DIN Range and Release

Here's where things get a bit technical, but I'll break it down for you. DIN range and release settings are crucial. DIN is the setting that determines how easily your bindings release when you take a tumble. Higher DIN settings are for more aggressive or heavier skiers who need their bindings to hold on tight. Lower settings are better for beginners or lighter skiers who want a bit more release flexibility. So, find that sweet spot that keeps you both secure and safe on the slopes.

The number listed with a ski binding, like the[Tyrolia Attack 14](https://www.curated.com/products/6523055/tyrolia-attack-14-gw-ski-bindings-2023?ref=journal), represents the highest DIN setting on the binding. All Alpine and some touring bindings have this DIN range. You’ll want to know your DIN before purchasing bindings because you don’t want them to be on either their absolute lowest DIN setting or their absolute highest DIN setting but somewhere in the middle. (If you’re unsure what your DIN setting would be,reach out to a Skiing Expert here on Curated!)

Another consideration is if you are park skiing or doing a lot of jumps, you will want to have your DIN setting slightly higher than a skier of your skill, height, and weight who isn’t doing jumps would because a higher DIN means more security of your boots staying in your binding when you land a jump.

### Compatibility With Boots and Skis

Of course, you can't forget about compatibility. Ski bindings need to fit well with your ski boots and skis. Double-check that the bindings you're eyeing match the type of boot sole you have. Most bindings are designed for Alpine (ISO 5355) or touring (ISO 9523) boot soles, so make sure they align. Additionally, consider the waist width of your skis and the ski brake width on the bindings, ensuring a snug fit of the brake arms without any overhang or underhang. It’s a good idea to run your binding choice by a Curated Skiing Expert if you are trying to figure out boot compatibility and need help determining the right brake width for the ski the bindings will be mounted on.

Note\:Ensure you always get your bindings mounted by a certified ski technician; don’t mount them at home! A certified technician will make sure your DIN setting is correct for your height, weight, and skier type and make sure your ski boots, bindings, and skis all fit together compatibly and size-wise.

### Weight and Materials

Weight matters, especially if you're into touring. Nobody wants to lug around heavy equipment when they're skinning up a mountain. Look for lightweight bindings made from materials like carbon or high-grade alloys. But don't sacrifice durability for weight alone. You want bindings that can handle the rigors of skiing without letting you down. Bindings that are made of plastic can sometimes break in colder weather or on tough landings in the park, and that would put an early end to your day on the slopes and could potentially be dangerous, so ensure the bindings you end up going with are sturdy and built to withstand cold weather and heavy use.
With this knowledge, let’s get into our list of the best ski bindings!

Alpine bindings, or downhill ski bindings, are the classic choice for resort skiing, providing skiers with stability, power transmission, and precise control. Let's dive into three of the best Alpine bindings on the market, each offering unique features and benefits.

### 1.[Marker Griffon 13 ID](https://www.curated.com/products/3798419/marker-griffon-13-id-ski-bindings-2025?ref=journal)

The Marker Griffon is a popular choice among intermediate to advanced skiers and easily the binding I recommend most often as a Curated Skiing Expert. Known for its reliability and performance, this binding delivers excellent power transmission and responsiveness, allowing you to carve those turns confidently. It also boasts a sturdy construction, utilizing top-quality materials for durability. It has some extra features in the toe piece that offer more reliable ejection when you take a fall, providing some extra protection against knee injuries.

If you're a lighter skier or prefer a slightly softer flex, the Marker Squire (comes in DINs 11 or 12) is a sibling of the Griffon and offers similar performance with a lower DIN range. Both bindings have an intelligent Triple Pivot Elite toe piece and a gliding AFD (Anti-Friction Device) for enhanced safety and smooth ski flex.

### 2.[LOOK Pivot](https://www.curated.com/products/8499994/look-pivot-14-gw-ski-bindings-2025?ref=journal)

The LOOK Pivot binding has garnered a cult-like following among expert skiers for its unmatched retention and elasticity. Its iconic turntable heel design provides exceptional shock absorption, reducing the risk of pre-release while ensuring consistent power transfer. The Pivot's Full Action toe piece offers superior energy transmission and a large range of elastic travel, making it ideal for aggressive skiers who push the limits. The binding's release system offers a reliable and precise release when needed, while the vertical heel elasticity helps reduce stress on the knees during intense maneuvers.

With its strong reputation for performance, the LOOK Pivot is a favorite among freestyle skiers who like to hit jumps and skiers tackling challenging and steep terrain. The most popular binding is the LOOK Pivot 14, but it also comes in 12, 15, and 18.

### 3.[Tyrolia Attack](https://www.curated.com/products/5091729/tyrolia-attack-12-gw-ski-bindings-2024?ref=journal)

The Tyrolia Attack binding combines versatility and performance, making it suitable for a wide range of skiers. Its lightweight construction and responsive design allow quick edge-to-edge transitions and a lively slope feel. The Attack features a unique toe design that provides optimal power transmission and energy absorption, promoting control and stability. It offers an adjustable DIN range, accommodating various skier profiles. Additionally, the binding's horizontal spring in the heel piece enhances elasticity and minimizes unwanted release.

The Tyrolia Attack also incorporates a safety feature known as the FR Pro² Toe, which provides increased vertical and lateral elasticity to reduce the risk of injury in demanding situations. It’s a bit less expensive than the Marker Griffon, so if you’re looking for a safe and reliable lower-priced option, the Attack is a great option. It comes in max DINs of 11, 12, and 14.

## Touring Bindings

Touring bindings, also known as backcountry or Alpine touring (AT) bindings, are specifically designed for skiers who venture beyond the resort boundaries. These bindings offer a combination of uphill efficiency and downhill stability, allowing skiers to climb uphill with ease and then lock in for descents.

### 4.[Fritschi Tecton 13](https://www.curated.com/products/6803004/black-diamond-fritschi-tecton-13-ski-bindings-2025?ref=journal)

The Fritschi Tecton 13 is a versatile touring binding that blends the uphill capabilities of a pin binding with the downhill feel of an Alpine binding. It offers a solid connection to the ski for confident descents while providing efficient touring functionality. The Tecton 13 features a unique toe piece with tech pins for reliable uphill performance and a sturdy Alpine-style heel piece that delivers exceptional power transmission. This combination allows for efficient climbing and precise downhill control.

The binding incorporates a lateral movement release mechanism in the toe piece, which helps reduce the risk of injury during twisting falls. It also has an easy-to-use step-in design and an adjustable DIN range for personalized release settings. The Fritschi Tecton 13 is a great choice for skiers who value the best of both worlds in terms of touring efficiency and downhill capability.

### 5.[Salomon MTN Pure](https://www.curated.com/products/6616635/salomon-mtn-pure-at-ski-bindings-2025?ref=journal)

The Salomon MTN Pure is a lightweight touring binding designed for those who prioritize uphill efficiency without compromising stability on the downhill. It features a low-profile design, utilizing lightweight materials such as carbon-infused components to minimize weight without sacrificing strength. The MTN Pure offers a convenient step-in system for quick transitions, and its wide toe piece enhances power transmission and stability during descents. This binding is ideal for skiers seeking a balance between weight savings and reliable performance.

Safety-wise, the MTN Pure has an adjustable release system for increased security, and the toe piece features an elastic travel mechanism to reduce the risk of pre-release. It is a bit less burly than some other touring bindings, which makes it great for weight savings, but it might not feel as sturdy to expert-level skiers looking to charge hard. Instead of having a numbered DIN, it has release settings for “women,” “men,” and “expert,” making it have a little fewer adjustment capabilities than other touring bindings that have the classic DIN number settings.

The Salomon S/Lab Shift MNC is a groundbreaking hybrid binding that has revolutionized the market. It seamlessly transitions from touring mode to full Alpine mode with just a flick of a lever. In touring mode, the Shift MNC utilizes a pin-toe design for efficient uphill travel. It transforms into a full Alpine binding when it's time to descend, delivering power and precision. This binding is compatible with Alpine ski and touring boots, making it incredibly versatile.

The Shift MNC offers a DIN range suitable for a wide range of skiers, and it features a robust construction for reliability on all types of terrain. Additionally, it incorporates a toe-release mechanism with elastic travel for added safety during unexpected impacts.

### 7.[Marker Kingpin](https://www.curated.com/products/6371391/marker-kingpin-13-ski-bindings-2025?ref=journal)

The Marker Kingpin is another popular hybrid binding that offers a blend of uphill efficiency and downhill performance. It features a pin-toe design that allows for smooth climbing with reduced weight. The Kingpin's innovative heel piece combines the benefits of a traditional Alpine binding with a pin binding, providing excellent power transmission and retention during descents. This binding is compatible with both Alpine and touring boot soles, offering versatility for various skiing preferences.

The Kingpin has a wide range of release values to accommodate different skier profiles and preferences. It also incorporates a six-pack Power Springs system that provides consistent retention and elasticity, enhancing safety and minimizing the risk of premature releases.
