title: 10 Gifts for People Who Love to Camp
---

Whether it’s a birthday, Christmas, Father’s Day, graduation, or another special occasion, shopping for the campers and outdoor adventurers in my life has always been my favorite kind of gift shopping! There are so many possibilities and options for outdoor gear; I’ve always thought it was fun to see what kind of cool camping gifts I could come up with. However, with so many gear options for camping, it is easy to get lost in all the possibilities and differentiate what is actually useful to bring along on a camping trip and what is not useful or practical.

As a camping enthusiast, I’ve done my fair share of testing gear and narrowing down what is actually useful and a great addition to any camper's gear setup. Here are the 10 best camping gift ideas to help you find the perfect gift for the camping lovers in your life!

## 10 Best Gift Ideas for Camping Lovers

##

### 1. Sun Hat

[The Kavu Onshore Sun Bloom Hat](https://www.curated.com/products/6342964/kavu-onshore-sun-bloom?ref=journal)

A hat to protect your face from the sun is a must for any camper! Kavu is my favorite for fun patterns, such as their Onshore Sun Bloom Hat or Caddie Hat, but something like the Pistil Topaz Wide Brim Hat also offers a lot of protection for campers who don’t like bright patterns.

### 2.[The North Face Wander Sun Hoodie](https://www.curated.com/products/5530112/the-north-face-women-s-wander-sun-hoodie?ref=journal)

Another key thing to bring camping is to protect yourself from the sun! I never go camping without my sun hoodie and usually wear it every day on every camping trip! The North Face Wander Sun Hoodie is really lightweight, dries quickly, has UPF 50+, and is odor resistant, so it’s perfect for summertime. This has saved me multiple times from getting a terrible sunburn, and if I get sunburned, it’s soft and light enough that it doesn’t hurt to wear over a sunburn. (Regular shirts always seem to feel like sandpaper to sunburnt shoulders!)

### 3. First Aid Kit

[The Adventure Medical Kits Mountain Series Medical Kit](https://www.curated.com/products/2954315/adventure-medical-kits-mountain-series-medical-kit-backpacker?ref=journal)

You can never have too many first aid kits; every camper should have at least one. I like the Adventure Medical Kit Mountain Backpacker Series because it is compact enough to toss in a bag for a day hike and extensive enough to include all the essentials for a night or two of backpacking. I always keep a bigger version of this same kit in my truck, just in case!

If you like this idea but want to gift your outdoor enthusiast something a little bigger than a first aid kit, pair a first aid kit with a registration for a NOLS Wilderness First Aid Class or something similar so your camper can have the tools to stay safe and know how to use them effectively! A few years ago for my birthday, my dad gifted me a first aid kit and registered me for a Wilderness First Aid Class, and it was easily one of the best gifts I’ve ever gotten. The knowledge of staying safe outdoors and the tools to do so make for a great camping gift.

### 4. Goal Zero Portable Device

[The Goal Zero Nomad 7](https://www.goalzero.com/products/nomad-7-solar-panel?ref=journal)

The[Goal Zero Nomad 7](https://www.goalzero.com/products/nomad-7-solar-panel?ref=journal)is portable, weather resistant, and has a USB plug that can charge your devices directly from the sun. The Nomad 7 is another one of the best camping gifts I have ever received. I have had mine for several years, and it still works great and is just as efficient as the day I got it! I usually bring a small battery pack, such as the[Goal Zero Flip 36](https://www.goalzero.com/products/flip-36-power-bank?ref=journal), so I can charge the power bank and use it at night/on cloudy days when the sun isn’t out.

If you want to go bigger, the[Yeti 200X Portable Power Bank](https://www.goalzero.com/collections/portable-power-stations/products/goal-zero-yeti-200x-portable-power-station?ref=journal)is rechargeable at home via a solar panel or a car charging cable. It charges devices ultra-fast and has plug-in options for a USB, USBC, regular wall plug, or car charger. I purchased this before a few-month road trip I was headed out on and it was incredibly useful for keeping my phone, camera, headlamp, and computer charged! I even use it daily around my house, just to charge my phone or other devices since it's so fast!

### 5. Outdoor Blanket

[The Therm-a-Rest Argo Blanket](https://www.curated.com/products/5156084/therm-a-rest-argo-blanket?ref=journal)

A blanket is a really versatile and useful gift for outdoor lovers! I have a down-insulated Rumpl blanket, which is very warm and pretty lightweight. It packs into its included stuff sack really easily, with many fun options for colors and patterns.

The Therm-a-Rest Argo Blanket is a great option as well, because not only is it down-insulated (super warm!), but it’s also water resistant so it can keep you cozy even in light rain. Many people use a blanket like this one in lieu of a sleeping bag on warm summer camping nights, especially ultralight backpackers who just bring a hammock and blanket as their sleeping setup (as opposed to carrying a tent which would be heavier).

### 6. Camp Lighting

[The Black Diamond Spot 400 Headlamp](https://www.curated.com/products/5594037/black-diamond-spot-400-headlamp-blue?ref=journal)

The possibilities when it comes to lighting are endless. A[headlamp](https://www.curated.com/products/5594037/black-diamond-spot-400-headlamp-blue?ref=journal)is always an awesome gift, especially for campers who tend to be more minimalist or are more into backpacking than car camping. I have two headlamps—one I keep in my truck, and one lives with my camping gear! It’s nice to have a backup in case the batteries die in one (toss in some extra batteries with this gift!).

If your camper is more into car camping, a camp lantern or some string lights would also make great gifts! Lanterns are heavier, so they are not great for the ultralight backpacker, but they provide more lighting, and many of them, such as the Black Diamond Moji, double as a power station and have USB ports that can charge a phone or other devices. String lights such as the[Luci Color Solar String Lights](https://www.curated.com/products/5092576/luci-color-solar-string-lights?ref=journal)make for a great ambiance around the campsite. They are especially nice to use in the tent while getting ready for bed or to read a book before bed.

### 7. Camp Stove

[The Camp Chef Everest HP 2 Burner Stove](https://www.curated.com/products/3049032/camp-chef-everest-hp-2-burner-stove?ref=journal)

For car campers, the Camp Chef Everest HP 2 Burner Stove has a double burner system, making bigger or more elaborate meals easy and efficient. If the camper in your life is more into backpacking, the[MSR Windburner Personal Stove System](https://www.curated.com/products/2950372/msr-windburner-personal-stove-system-black?ref=journal)is a great, lightweight option that can boil water for dehydrated meals and cook smaller serving sizes of things like pasta and oatmeal.

(Bonus: throw in a few Backpacker’s Pantry Meals, some[camp mugs](https://www.curated.com/products/4889497/gsi-outdoors-infinity-backpacker-mug?ref=journal), or some reusable utensils to ensure your camper is ready for their next outdoor dining experience.)

### 8. Sleeping Bag Liner

[The Sea to Summit Premium Blended Silk/Cotton Liner](https://www.curated.com/products/2956806/sea-to-summit-silk-cotton-travel-host-liner-navy?ref=journal)

I personally think it’s hard to buy a sleeping bag for someone else unless you have many details about what your camper is looking to use it for. (If you do,talk to a Camping and Hiking Expert here on Curatedwho would be happy to suggest some bags that fit your camper's needs).

However, a sleeping bag liner is a great gift. Liners are used inside of a sleeping bag to both add a bit of warmth and keep the inside of the bag clean. I have used one for years, and it’s never something I would have thought to buy myself, but I love it, and as a cold person, I appreciate that it keeps me a bit warmer at night!

### 9.[Cooler](https://www.curated.com/products/5507019/coleman-convoy-series-55-quart-cooler-cloud?ref=journal)

[The Coleman Convoy Series 55-Quart Cooler](https://www.curated.com/products/5507019/coleman-convoy-series-55-quart-cooler-cloud?ref=journal)

A cooler is another thing that I had a hard time buying myself! The first few years I went on camping trips as an adult, I tried to bring food that didn’t need to be kept cold. But once I finally got a cooler, it was a game-changer! Having one expanded my options for what I could make for food while camping. (Additionally, many coolers also double as a nice chair for sitting around the campfire!)

I use a Yeti 65L Tundra, which is a bit big for one person or two people on weekend trips but is awesome for longer trips and trips with more people. It’s totally worth every cent with the amount of time it keeps my food cold, but if you aren’t looking to spend that much, the Coleman Convoy 55 L Cooler is also a great, durable option that will keep your camper's food and beer cold on their next camping trip!

### 10.[Garmin InReach](https://www.curated.com/products/5594005/garmin-inreach-mini-2?ref=journal)

And last but not least, if you are looking to spend a little more and the person in your life is a serious camper, hiker, climber, etc., the Garmin InReach is a great gift. The InReach is a satellite communicator that can send and receive text messages and transmit SOS signals. I’ve personally witnessed and heard countless[stories of InReaches or similar devices saving campers, hikers, and other outdoor enthusiasts](https://www.curated.com/journal/632000/how-curated-expert-advice-saved-a-hikers-life?ref=journal)when things go wrong at a campsite or on a trail that doesn’t have phone service.

I see it as an essential piece of survival gear and take mine on longer hikes and runs I do in areas without service and absolutely every time I go camping. It requires a $9 monthly subscription fee, but it is worth it for the peace of mind of knowing your loved one is safe and for your loved one as a lifeline if anything were to go wrong on their adventures!
