## 10 Expert-Recommended Hammocks

### Single Hammocks

### 1. ENO SingleNest Hammock

The ENO SingleNest Hammock is a compact and durable hammock designed for solo campers and hikers. Made from high-strength, breathable nylon, this hammock has a weight capacity of 400 pounds but weighs only 16 ounces. It comes in tons of fun colors, and the cinch straps on the side of the stuff sack allow it to pack down to the size of a grapefruit. It is one of the best camping hammocks in terms of both ease of use and portability.

- Material\:High-strength, breathable nylon
- Weight:16 ounces

### Double Hammocks

### 2. Eno DoubleNest Hammock

A double version of the Eno SingleNest, the DoubleNest hammock is perfect for camping, backpacking, or even just lounging in the backyard. It's made from high-strength nylon that's both lightweight and durable, and it comes in a variety of fun colors and designs.
With a weight capacity of 400 pounds, the DoubleNest can comfortably fit two people, or one person and their gear. It's easy to set up and pack away, and it comes with an attached stuff sack for convenient storage and transport.

- Material\:High-strength nylon

### 3. Grand Trunk Double Parachute Nylon Hammock

The Grand Trunk Double Parachute Nylon Hammock is another spacious and comfortable double hammock that's great for sleeping or hanging out—no matter where you are.

With the same weight capacity of 400 pounds, it’s a great option for two people. Each side features a built-in carabiner that easily attaches to loops on the suspension system—making it quick and easy to set up and take down. However, it’s slightly heavier than the ENO DoubleNest, and has a different type of stuff sack which doesn’t pack down quite as small.

- Weight:28 oz

### Family Hammocks

The Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammock is a wallet-friendly option that's perfect for minimalist backpackers and hikers. Made from high-strength nylon, this hammock has a weight capacity of 200 pounds but weighs only 12 ounces. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that some hammocks have (such as a rain fly or bug net), but it will get the job done and is a perfect starting option for those just getting into hammock camping—or for those who prioritize affordability!

- Material\:High-strength nylon
- Weight:12 oz

### 6. Kammock Mantis Ultralight Hammock

The Kammock Mantis Ultralight Hammock is another of the best backpacking hammocks on the market. Made from a blend of nylon and polyester, this hammock can support up to 300 pounds and weighs only 10.4 ounces—making it one of the lightest on the market, too.

The Mantis Ultralight features a unique diamond ripstop pattern which provides excellent strength and durability, and comes with Kammock's proprietary Python Straps—the most tree friendly and lightest suspension straps available. The hammock also comes with an integrated bug net that can be stored away when not in use, as well as a built-in rain fly.

- Material\:Diamond ripstop fabric
- Weight:10 ounces

### 7. ENO Sub6 Hammock

The ENO Sub6 Hammock is a great option for any camper looking for an ultralight hammock that doesn't sacrifice comfort. Made from a blend of nylon and polyester, this hammock weighs only 5.8 ounces—making it one of the most lightweight hammocks on the market. Despite that, the Sub6 Hammock can support up to 300 pounds, and features a comfortable, breathable design that’s perfect for warm-weather camping.

- Material\:Proprietary nylon fabric
- Weight:5.8 oz

### Hammock Tents

### 8.[Tentsile Flite+ Hammock Tent](https://www.tentsile.com/collections/2-person-tree-tents/products/flite-2-person-hammock-tent?ref=journal)

The Tentsile Flite+ is a unique, full-shelter system that can be used as either a hammock or on-the-ground tent. It's made from high-quality ripstop nylon and has a weight capacity of 485 lbs. This hammock tent weighs in at just 10.4 lbs, making it a great option for backpackers and hikers who want a comfortable and versatile shelter.

The bed consists of two hammocks side by side with a divider down the middle—which makes it comfortable whether you’re camping alone or with another. It comes with a removable rainfly and built-in bug net, and offers tons of head room—making it easy and comfortable to sit up inside.

- Material\:Ripstop nylon
- Weight:10.4 lbs

### 9.[Tentsile Stingray 3-Person Tree Tent](https://www.tentsile.com/products/stingray-3-person-tree-tent?ref=journal)

Offering a bit more room, the Tentsile Stingray Tree Tent is designed for up to three people, or two adults and two kids. This hammock tent has a weight limit of 880 lbs, and features a waterproof rainfly and insect mesh to keep you protected from the elements. Marketed as “a treehouse in a bag,” this is a fun option for those with kids, and campers looking to set up their tent without the need to search for flat ground. It’s quite a bit heavier than the Flite+, but exceptionally durable and great for car campers.

- Material\:Ripstop nylon
- Weight:24.4 lbs

### Spreader Bar Hammocks

### 10. Eno Skyloft Hammock

The Eno Skyloft Hammock is made from a high-strength nylon fabric that's both breathable and durable, making it ideal for long-term use. It utilizes two aluminum spreader bars on either end, allowing the hammock to lay flatter than others. As a result, it’s a bit more comfortable to sleep in for those planning on using a sleeping pad for added comfort and insulation.

The aluminum bars make the Skyloft a bit bulker than other options; but if you’re looking to use it for hiking or backpacking, it can be set up without its bars also. It has an integrated gear loft and stash pockets that are perfect for storing essentials, and it comes in a travel-ready stuff sack that doubles as an attachable pillow.

- Material\:Nylon
- Weight:3.38 lbs
